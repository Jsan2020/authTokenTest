Its audience is 39% greater than #2 Sony. Among the top 3 biggest audiences, it has the largest ratio of participants to subscribers &#8211; 37% greater than Sony and 44%  greater than Microsoft. For the top 10 brands with the highest post counts, the brand also maintains the highest engagement score.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Samsung is working hard to keep its large audience engaged, and to produce share-worthy content for its active subscribers. The brand’s engagement score is 35% greater than is typical for the top consumer electronics brands.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Top 10 Audience Size</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Samsung</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sony Electronics</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Microsoft Electronics</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nintendo</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">HP Electronics</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nokia</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Apple</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">EA</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Blackberry</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">LG Electronics</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Top 10 Engagement Score</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Samsung</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">EA</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sony</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Microsoft</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Apple</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nintendo</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nokia</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">LG</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Beats By Dre</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sharp</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Most Social Accounts: Sony</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-99776 aligncenter\" title=\"social media influence\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Sony-Youtube.png\" alt=\"social media influence\" width=\"651\" height=\"393\" /></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sony manages 323 company accounts within its electronics division across all major social networks, 25% greater than the amount of Samsung&#8217;s company accounts. The brand is actively managing social experiences for consumers across social touchpoints, leveraging the most accounts amongst competitors to effectively reach consumers.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The brand also comes out on top with amount of posts, 10% higher than Microsoft and 20% higher than Samsung. Sony’s engagement score is almost 35% greater than the average engagement score amongst the top 10.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Top 10 Number of Company Accounts</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sony Electronics</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Microsoft Electronics</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Samsung Electronics</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nokia</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">HP</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">LG Electronics</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nikon</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Dell Electronics</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Panasonic Electronics</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Toshiba</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Best Audience: Sharp</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-99777 aligncenter\" title=\"social media influence\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Sharp-Europe-Facebook.png\" alt=\"social media influence\" width=\"644\" height=\"412\" /></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sharp has the highest ratio of subscribers to participants amongst its competitors, 3X greater than #2 Lenovo and 5X greater than #3 Nikon. It’s subscriber-to-participant ratio is also 10X greater than the average ratio amongst the top 10.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sharp maintains its loyal, active audience base across all social channels, and ranks amongst the top 10 in engagement scores as well.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Top 10 Participant-to-Subscriber Ratio</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sharp Electronics</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Xiaomi</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lenovo</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nikon</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nokia</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Hitachi</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Apple</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">HTC</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Panasonic</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Samsung</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Honorable Mentions: Microsoft, Nokia, Apple</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Microsoft</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Microsoft is a consistently strong performer across all categories measured. Microsoft&#8217;s audience is 2X greater than Apple&#8217;s, and also has a higher engagement score than Apple (even with a larger audience). Microsoft’s audience is 30% greater than the average audience size of the top 10 largest audiences.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-99778 aligncenter\" title=\"social media influence\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Microsoft-Pintrest.png\" alt=\"social media influence\" width=\"668\" height=\"557\" /></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Nokia</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nokia ranked in the top 10 in all of our categories, indicating strong social activity overall. The brand maintains an audience 3X the size of Blackberry’s with subscribers 19X more engaged. Amongst brands with the top 10 biggest audiences, Nokia has the highest participant-to-subscriber ratio.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"wp-image-99779 aligncenter\" title=\"social media influence\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Nokia-Instagram.jpg\" alt=\"social media influence\" width=\"384\" height=\"576\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Apple</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Apple’s iconic brand image keeps its loyal audiences active, engaged, and conversational with the brand. Apple’s participant-to-subscriber ratio is 2X the size of the average ratio amongst brands with the biggest audiences. Apple’s engagement score is 35% greater than the top 10 brands with the largest engagement scores. This activity is primarily driven by iTunes and AppStore activity, as the brand does not utilize social as a content distribution or engagement hub.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-99780 aligncenter\" title=\"social media influence\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Apple-YouTube.png\" alt=\"social media influence\" width=\"542\" height=\"380\" /></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Social experience management isn&#8217;t easy.

This includes the use of integrated brand health benchmarking tools, listening tools and an automated optimization rules engine.</p>\n<h2>Always-on Paid Social</h2>\n<p>The reality of Facebook is that without paid activity, a brand’s posts will be seen by just a handful of its fans. As Facebook phases out organic reach altogether, the Sprinklr platform will become an indispensable tool for the many brands that are making the transition from a mix of organic content distribution and sporadic campaigns to always-on paid social.</p>\n<p>Sprinklr unlocks access to your competitor’s social performance. Users can take advantage of unparalleled real-time brand measurement and competitive reporting to analyze how paid media effects brand metrics versus competitors — then make changes to help you get ahead.</p>\n<p>The Sprinklr module uses an Excel-like interface for ad creation, which means the ad ops team doesn’t need to change existing processes. They can also upload their Power Editor spreadsheets, making it easy to give Sprinklr a try.</p>\n<h2>Benefits for agencies</h2>\n<p>On top of these benefits, Sprinklr has additional features that will appeal to agencies that are looking to streamline the collaboration and approval process and find ways to get the most out of their client’s budgets. Agencies using Sprinklr can leverage global client data by viewing the performance of all clients and brands and using it to plan future campaigns.</p>\n<h2>Automated optimization</h2>\n<p>Sprinklr’s sophisticated rules engine allows users to automatically optimize or amplify content based on a flexible set of rules. Allocate extra budget, pause creative and perform many other actions based on an extensive range of variables. Rules are easily created and edited using drop down menus and visual flow charts.</p>\n<h2>The bottom line</h2>\n<p>The overriding benefit for switching to Sprinklr is the efficiency gained from having everything in one place. As social media has matured the software required to manage activity and data have proliferated requiring one or more separate tools to manage organic posts, paid activity, measure performance and manipulate data. On social platforms, paid, earned and owned media don’t exist as separate silos — each informs the others, and they combine to create the most effective media strategies.</p>\n<h2>For brands that require maximum reach on the largest platforms, an always-on paid social strategy is a must.</h2>\n<p>Sprinklr brings everything under one roof, improving efficiency and bringing value added tools to your fingertips. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sprinklr.com/social-paid-whitepaper/\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-104970\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Paid-Social-CTA-graphic.jpg\" alt=\"Paid-Social-CTA-graphic\" width=\"735\" height=\"250\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>About the Author: </strong><a title=\"Simon Mansell Twitter\" href=\"https://twitter.com/simonmansell\" target=\"_blank\">Simon Mansell</a> is a General Manager at Sprinklr.</p>\n",

The festival has long been a place where films are bought, sold, and prepared for international success, with many American films eventually making their way to the Oscars.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This year we watched the 2014 festival, not from the French Riviera, but from the Sprinklr offices where we used our<a href=\"https://www.sprinklr.com/social-media-management-system/enterprise-social-media-listening/\"> Listening Insights</a> to track social conversations around Cannes sponsors, plus nominated films and directors.<!--more--></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As of Sunday morning, Cannes 2014 garnered a total of 3.4 million mentions between April 25 and May 25, 2014.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"wp-image-99729 aligncenter\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/1Cannes_Volume_Trend.png\" alt=\"Volume of Social Media at Cannes\" width=\"706\" height=\"144\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">The top hashtags used to discuss the festival were #cannes2014 and #cannes, with #selfie coming in at third.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"wp-image-99730 aligncenter\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/2Cannes_Top_Hashtags.png\" alt=\"Cannes Film Festival Top Social Media Hashtags\" width=\"470\" height=\"295\" /></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Twitter, Tumblr, and Instagram were the top three used platforms, with Facebook coming in sixth, behind WordPress and news mentions.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"wp-image-99731 aligncenter\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/3Cannes_olume_Distribution_by_Source.png\" alt=\"Most Popular Social Networks at Cannes Film Festival\" width=\"548\" height=\"227\" /></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The conversation was slightly more dominated by males, with English and French being the two most used languages.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"> <img class=\"wp-image-99732 aligncenter\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/4Cannes_Demographics.png\" alt=\"Social Media Demographics for Cannes Film Festival\" width=\"885\" height=\"311\" /></p>\n<h2>How did the sponsors perform in social media at Cannes?</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Cannes Film Festival had five major sponsors this year: Chopard, L’Oreal Paris, HP, Renault, and Akamai, with an array of smaller sponsorships from other brands and French organizations. The true winners were beauty and luxury brands who took center stage right along with the celebrities.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Chopard</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The one sponsor who clearly dominated the conversation was Chopard, the Swiss luxury jeweler who has crafted the festival’s coveted Palme d’Or trophy since 1998. Their jewelry is also featured on almost every actress who walks the red carpet.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This year the brand went green with the first ever ‘Fairmined’ certified gold Palme d’Or trophy.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet tw-align-center\" lang=\"en\"><p>The legendary <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23PalmedOr&amp;src=hash\">#PalmedOr</a> is turning “green”! This year it will be made of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Fairmined&amp;src=hash\">#Fairmined</a> gold. <a href=\"http://t.co/E0Nzfd9kzK\">http://t.co/E0Nzfd9kzK</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/tdjQbeFvUx\">pic.twitter.com/tdjQbeFvUx</a></p>\n<p>— Chopard Official (@Chopard) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Chopard/statuses/467329696783269889\">May 16, 2014</a></p></blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Between their eco-friendly initiatives and having the the most coveted product placement spot of the event (literally right on celebrities’ faces), the luxury brand managed to garner over 21.6k mentions and win the top spot for Cannes sponsors.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>L’Oreal</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">L’Oreal, like Chopard, had the benefit of being close to the red carpet action, but unlike other sponsors, the majority of their mentions came from Thailand who accounted for 46% of the conversations happening around L’Oreal. This was most likely due to their partnership with Thai actress, Araya &#8216;Chompoo&#8217; A. Hargate, who was selected to be a presenter for L’Oreal makeup throughout the week.</p>\n<div id=\"fb-root\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-99740 aligncenter\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/6LOreal_Post.png\" alt=\"L'Oreal - Cannes Film Festival Social Media\" width=\"353\" height=\"496\" /></div>\n<div></div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Renault</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The brand we were surprised to see not perform well was Renault, one of Europe’s biggest automakers, who brought in a low 288 mentions. The brand has been a sponsor of the festival for over 30 years and has had the honor of escorting every celebrity to the red carpet in one of their vehicles. Unfortunately, this was not enough to dominate the conversation or create much buzz. This could be due to their siloed social channels and a lack of presence in the U.S.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"wp-image-99741 aligncenter\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/7Renault_Post.png\" alt=\"Renault - Cannes Film Festival Social Media \" width=\"661\" height=\"295\" /></p>\n<h2>Who got the most social media buzz at Cannes?</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Until the awards were announced on Saturday evening, Ryan Gosling dominated, both, our director and film insight boards, but not for the best reasons. The American actor, whose directorial debut took place this year at Cannes, was the laughingstock amongst the festival’s harshest critics. The actor’s first mishap was when he arrived on the red carpet wearing a tuxedo sans tie, but the bigger blow came after the screening of his film, Lost River. According to <a href=\"http://insidemovies.ew.com/2014/05/20/ryan-goslings-lost-river-cannes/\">Entertainment Weekly</a>, “Boos reportedly drowned out the applause.”</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet tw-align-center\" lang=\"en\"><p>Is Ryan Gosling&#8217;s Lost River the worst movie debuting at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Cannes&amp;src=hash\">#Cannes</a> that was made by an actor? <a href=\"http://t.co/6osWIoOdQJ\">http://t.co/6osWIoOdQJ</a></p>\n<p>— Vogue Magazine (@voguemagazine) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/voguemagazine/statuses/469597353197174784\">May 22, 2014</a></p></blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Gosling ended his week with a total of 36.1k mentions for himself and 39.4k mentions for his film. It might be time to update the age-old saying— bad press is good social reach.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Which film won the social Palme d’Or?</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On Saturday evening, Cannes’ very own boy wonder, Quentin Tarantino, handed the Palme d’Or to Nuri Bilge Ceylan for Winter Sleep and closed the festival with a showing of Sergio Leone&#8217;s spaghetti western, A Fistful of Dollars.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here are the Official Selection films ranked by how they performed across social.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"wp-image-99734 aligncenter\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/9Cannes_Films_Ranking.png\" alt=\"Cannes Film Festival Official Selections on Social Media\" width=\"615\" height=\"402\" /></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Interested in more social media analytics?<a href=\"/?page_id=1752\"> Sign up and stay in touch!</a></h3>\n",

Having bought more than $500M of social advertising over the years, I should know.</p>\n<h3>Sprinklr’s new capability enables brands and their agencies to plan, execute, measure and optimize Facebook and Twitter paid social activities in real-time and in the same environment as their owned and earned engagement.</h3>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">The launch of this paid capability is the result of a partnership between Sprinklr and TBG, a global social media agency I founded in 2001 that develops paid media solutions for social networks. TBG helps brands drive marketing performance through social channels and enables clients to align social strategy with business goals.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Sprinklr has been working with TBG for the last six months to develop this module, and we are now pleased to launch it together. The product incorporates four key functions:</span></p>\n<h2>Paid Execution</h2>\n<p>Fully integrated with Sprinklr’s engagement platform, a sophisticated rules engine that allows brands to automatically optimize or amplify content based on a flexible set of rules.</p>\n<h2>Advanced Reporting</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Use real time data, such as mentions and sentiment, to gauge brand campaign performance as it happens, for both paid and earned media.</p>\n<h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a result of Sprinklr’s acquisition of Dachis Group, there will be unparalleled real-time brand measurement and competitive reporting within the platform. Brands can look at real time signals on four dimensions of brand health: Awareness, Love, Mindshare and Advocacy &#8212; allowing brands to review share of voice and the effect their paid spend is having versus competitors.</p>\n<h2>First-Party Data (coming soon!)</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Automatically store or link to data on customers (e.g., email records), enabling brands to understand consumer interests. Based on the information consumers publish on social networks, brands can use the Sprinklr platform to target the appropriate content based on interests. Brands can accurately measure the performance of this content, by feeding in data on the real sales impact to the group of customers.</p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">TBG and Sprinklr are excited to bring this product to market together. The combination of real time analytics data and paid media execution will usher in the next generation in paid social.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">We couldn’t be happier to be a part of it.</span></p>\n<h3>To learn more about Sprinklr’s new paid module, sign up for a tour here or email <a href=\"mailto:marketing@spr.com\">marketing@spr.com</a>.</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sprinklr.com/social-paid-whitepaper/\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-104970\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Paid-Social-CTA-graphic.jpg\" alt=\"Paid-Social-CTA-graphic\" width=\"735\" height=\"250\" /></a></p>\n",

Nothing is new under the sun.”</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>So, I’ll share with you a framework that I cannot take credit for, but one that I think creates a simplified view to answer the question…</p>\n<h2>How do you build a social infrastructure that enables your organization to be social?</h2>\n<p>A student in my MBA program, Matthew Bothner, former professor at the University of Chicago Booth School Of Business and now current professor at the European School of Management and Technology, introduced to me the best filter I have encountered in evaluating whether an organizational infrastructure is fit for purpose to accomplish anything: the ARC.</p>\n<p>This acronym stands for “Architecture, Routines, and Culture.” Professor Bothner submitted a simple concept behind this framework: If your ARC is broken, your strategy will fail. With that concept in mind, let’s evaluate how to build an ARC for an organization that is going to &#8220;be social.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The following two diagrams show the ARC cycle and the definition of each component, and the translation of those elements to a social infrastructure:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-99544\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/arc-structure-by-kenyata-martin.png\" alt=\"arc structure by kenyata martin\" width=\"400\" height=\"325\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-99543\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/arc-cycle-by-kenyata-martin.png\" alt=\"arc cycle by kenyata martin\" width=\"100%\" height=\"517\" /></p>\n<p>While this is a very simplified view of how to begin creating an infrastructure that will allow your organization to be social, I think the best frameworks are the simple ones. They’re easy to remember, and generally elegant enough to absorb all the weeds you can get into when working through the maze of social media tools available to communicate to your consumers, customers, or both.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>About the author:</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/yataman\">Kenyata Martin</a> is responsible for increasing marketing capability within the NA Lubricants’ organization, as well as delivering scaled marketing strategies that have direct-to-consumer impact on both the B2C &amp; B2B businesses.

Today, it is vast and complex, with 300,000 flights every day. As a result, we have seen the establishment of governing bodies — including the FAA in the U.S., and air traffic control throughout the world — to regulate and coordinate air traffic.</p>\n<p>This requires policies, processes, training, and technology, and without this infrastructure, modern air traffic would be completely unfeasible.<!--more--></p>\n<h2>How Social Business Is Similar</h2>\n<p>Companies have embraced social media as a way to engage their customers. But as a result, they have to contend with hundreds of accounts and thousands of conversations, all across multiple business units, geographies, and end users.</p>\n<p>Without investing in an infrastructure to manage this, brands expose themselves to great risk. Not only can a single post or tweet do incredible damage to a brand’s reputation in a very short period of time, but customers expect consistency across all of a brand’s touchpoints and departments.</p>\n<h2>In our research, we’ve found that social business routinely involves up to 13 business units.</h2>\n<p>Marketing, corporate communications, sales, customer service, loyalty, human resources, and others all have an interest in engaging with customers and prospects.</p>\n<p>In order for these diverse and distributed groups to work together effectively, they need to have access to the right information and the ability to coordinate activities in real time. They need a combination of policies, processes, education, and technology. Without a social infrastructure, social business is simply impossible.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p>About the author:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/andrewjns\">Andrew Jones</a> is an analyst at Altimeter Group.

It gives brands and their agencies the ability to plan, execute, and optimize their paid activities on social media channels in the same environment as their owned and earned engagement.</p>\n<h2 style=\"margin-top: 20px;\">Early clients have reported an over 25% increase in ad performance as a result of:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>coordinating content across owned, earned and paid</li>\n<li>benchmarking brand health and quantifying brand impact (based on the core brand analytics technology acquired via Dachis Group)</li>\n<li>integrated listening to surface high-impact messaging opportunities</li>\n<li>social automation that optimizes testing and budget re-allocation in real time</li>\n<li>advanced workflow and approval features to coordinate across agencies and multiple departments</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The module will be widely available to all clients in six weeks.</p>\n<h2 style=\"margin-top: 30px;\">$40M Series D Funding from ICONIQ Capital, Battery Ventures, and Intel Capital</h2>\n<p>In addition to the launch of paid, Sprinklr has closed a $40M Series D round of funding led by <a href=\"http://iconiqcapital.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ICONIQ Capital</a>. Existing investors, <a href=\"http://www.battery.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Battery Ventures</a> and <a href=\"http://www.intelcapital.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Intel Capital</a>, also participated in the round.</p>\n<p>As some of you know, Sprinklr has been fortunate to have a great group of investors in Battery Ventures and Intel Capital. In addition, we’ve been fortunate to have a steady stream of inbound venture capital interest culminating in this investment from ICONIQ Capital. I suspect that if it was anyone but ICONIQ, it would have been a lot harder to convince our existing partners to let the new investor lead.</p>\n<p>This round of funding is a testament to our vision for experience management across every enterprise touchpoint &#8212; every team, department, division and location. We will use the funds to fuel projected growth of 300% this year and to invest even further in our organization and product.</p>\n<h3 style=\"margin-top: 20px;\">On behalf of all Sprinklrites, I’d like to give a heartfelt thank you to every one of our client partners, investors, and the growing extended family of industry influencers whose support we rely on.</h3>\n<p>We are building a new kind of company. A company that not only has the best product for the social age, but also cares more passionately and genuinely about its clients’ success than any other.</p>\n<p>It’s going to take many more years of hard work, a lot of luck, and your prayers, but we’ll get there.</p>\n<p>Back to work now.

              "rendered": "<h2>Social Media Analytics for the Green Jacket Tournament</h2>\n<p>Golf tournament season kicked off this past weekend with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/The_Masters\">The Masters</a>. While this 80-year-old event has been a fan favorite for decades, this year was especially exciting as the world took to social media to engage with players, sponsors, and tournament events. We turned on Sprinklr&#8217;s Listening Insights to determine the most popular on social among golf players, sponsorship campaigns, and topics.<!--more (read me...)--><br />\n<a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Masters-Count-General-Monday-Latest.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-99200 aligncenter\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Masters-Count-General-Monday-Latest.png\" alt=\"Sprinklr Listening Mentions Count General The Masters\" width=\"546\" height=\"118\" /></a><br />\nAs of Monday morning, The Masters garnered a total of 767,900 mentions on social channels including Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook, and WordPress. This number includes both owned and earned mentions.<br />\n<a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Top_Hashtags-General-Monday.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-99189 aligncenter\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Top_Hashtags-General-Monday.png\" alt=\"Sprinklr Listening Top Hashtags General The Masters\" width=\"814\" height=\"528\" /></a><br />\nThe top hashtags used to discuss the tournament were #masters2014 and #themasters.</p>\n<h2>Which sponsor scored a hole-in-one?</h2>\n<p>The Masters had five sponsors this year: AT&amp;T, IBM, Mercedes-Benz, Rolex, and UPS. See how they ranked:</p>\n<p><a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/the-masters-sponsors.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-99226\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/the-masters-sponsors.jpg\" alt=\"social mentions among sponsors of the masters tournament\" width=\"100%\" /></a></p>\n<h4>IBM</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/IBM\">IBM</a> was the winner, by quite a landslide, with 50% of social mentions as of Monday morning. The brand gained significant media attention for its <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/IBM\" target=\"_blank\">televised ad campaign</a>, which featured 45 different spots on how different types of companies use IBM to collect data. Traditionally at major sporting events, brands air the same spots over and over, since viewers pick-and-choose events to watch.

For businesses, information flow is changing from a top-down model, where media outlets and brands have the dominant voice, to a more democratic model, where the dominant voice is held by communities of customers and employees. Wherever they are, so is your business.</p>\n<p>As I see it, there are three points to consider on your path to becoming a social business: <!--more--></p>\n<h2>I. Social is the New Production Line</h2>\n<p>Social media has had a sweeping impact on human interaction, fundamentally changing how we engage with one another. The touchpoints of business are no longer contained within brick and mortar, but extend beyond the enterprise through a connected network of your clients, your products, and your workforce.</p>\n<p>Social connects people so they can work together to create value – share ideas, innovate, solve problems. In fact, social is becoming the new standard expectation of how employees and customers interact with organizations. A social business will support social engagement within the organization and drive more relevant, engaging customer experiences.</p>\n<h2>II. Social is the New Intelligence for Business</h2>\n<p>Social is providing a new human face to data. Social data gives you a wealth of insight to improve individual connections and information sharing, to create opportunities for collaboration and innovation, and to see trends earlier. Whether social interactions are occurring inside or outside of your organization, you have a new natural resource in social data that can be mined for competitive advantage.</p>\n<p>Winning businesses in the era of social business will harness social data and analytics throughout their enterprises to improve employee and customer experience and tap into the power of collective intelligence to drive innovation.</p>\n<h2>III. Social is the Future of How Modern Enterprises Work</h2>\n<p>Social interaction between people is increasingly the way work gets done in the modern enterprise. Benefiting from social centricity requires a strategic approach that looks at each element of your business operating model – including the processes, people, and technologies that span the value chain – to identify the biggest opportunities to reduce cost, increase speed, and leverage new sources of information to innovate.</p>\n<p>Social business is about harnessing these dynamics to unleash innovation across all the touchpoints, transforming your people, your product, and your client experience for greater value.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p>About the author:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/tamicann\">Tami Cannizzaro</a> is responsible for driving IBM’s Social Business initiative, which helps companies to improve sales, marketing, and workforce productivity by building social into the fabric of their organizations.

And all of this happened within the span of three tweets.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>I recently sat down with Kimpton’s Social Media Manager Whitney Smith to better understand their approach to customer service and how they manage to consistently deliver at every customer touchpoint.</p>\n<p>Turns out, it’s a rather simple formula &#8212; as many great ones are. Throughout the day, no matter where you are: at a physical location, on social media, over the phone, via email etc., Kimpton is going to do all they can to appreciate you. The ultimate goal is to have a &#8216;Kimpton Moment.&#8217;</p>\n<h2>What is a Kimpton Moment?</h2>\n<p><i>“</i>It’s a ridiculously personal experience between you and another person.” If you check any of their social feeds, you&#8217;ll see that Kimpton Moments are happening every single day across the country. Many of these are powered through social.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A team of social agents monitor the social web almost 24 hours a day, 7 days a week assisting customers, posting content, and looking for potential Kimpton Moments.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>When a potential Kimpton Moment is found, the social team gathers as much information as they can without prying.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The Kimpton Moment is then routed down to the property level where the property takes the contextual information provided and comes up with the ridiculously personal experiences that many guests encounter.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Kimpton takes a common social theme &#8212; real-time empowerment of employees to make a difference &#8212; and expands it across the entire org.</h2>\n<p>“Employees are encouraged to take an idea and run with it. No matter what it is,” Whitney said. “If the director of housekeeping at a property wants to begin managing their property’s social channels, we give them the tools and training to do it.” [That really happened.]</p>\n<p>“If a guest is missing the series finale of Breaking Bad because we don’t carry AMC, the local front office manager is empowered to decide that this guest needs a reservation at a local bar that’s having a watch party,” she continued. “While the guest is out, a ridiculously personal Walter White amenity is delivered to the guest’s room… &#8216;rock&#8217; candy included.” [That also, really happened.]</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-98957\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/a-kimpton-moment.jpg\" alt=\"a kimpton moment\" width=\"438\" height=\"338\" /></p>\n<p>Social media has always been a channel to share, inquire about, and understand experiences. A recent shift &#8212; and one that I believe Kimpton is defining &#8212; is beginning to take shape on the brand side of social: the ability to help craft and manage these experiences for your customers.</p>\n<h2>Customer experiences don’t have to be on the level of a ridiculously personal experience.</h2>\n<p>They can include small things such as noticing particular interests from previous posts and weaving that into the conversation, connecting like-minded individuals, or even just addressing someone by name when speaking with them.</p>\n<p>The guiding principle Whitney and her team base their interaction strategy on (which can be adopted regardless of vertical, organization or team): <strong>Care is key</strong>.</p>\n<p>The act of travel, at times can be faceless, uncomfortable, foreign (literally and figuratively), and stressful. Kimpton strives to make you feel at home when you’re with them. Your home, with all your preferences. This goes a long way to creating brand loyalists. They’ve got two more after my recent stay at Hotel La Jolla.<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.sprinklr.com/customer-experience-ebook/\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-106004\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Download-Ebook-CXM-CTA-graphic.jpg\" alt=\"Get our Customer Experience eBook\" width=\"735\" height=\"250\" /></a><br />\n<strong>About the author:</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MacJ12\">Justin Macauley</a> is solutions consultant at Sprinklr. Originally from Los Angeles, Justin graduated from the University of Colorado in 2011 &#8212; Go Buffs!

              "rendered": "<p>Brands have been doing social media listening way before social listening became a ‘thing.’ They set up queries on listening tools to discover conversations about themselves and their competitors. They extracted these insights to advise corporate strategy.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em;\">Since then, the space hasn’t evolved a lot. Solutions have folded, solutions have been acquired, and we’re still watching line graphs go up and down and word clouds change. We continue believing certain myths about social media listening.</span></p>\n<p>That is all they are &#8212;  myths.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h3>Myth 1: Consumption of Data Is All You Need</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Imagine presenting to the executives at your organization copious amounts of data on company performance and brand perception, then telling them “but… you can’t do anything about this.” Miss CMO would laugh at you; data is meant to be insightful and actionable, not consumed and archived. And social data has to be just that – insightful and actionable – you have to put it into work queues for teams to address, categorize and profile, engage with newfound conversation, and support CRM efforts.</p>\n<p>We’re in the conversation economy, not the sit-and-do-nothing economy.</p>\n<h3>Myth 2: Social Media Listening Is ‘Set It and Forget It’</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the age of the second screen &#8212; when news stories break on Twitter before CNN can put together a script and PR directors become viral sensations between airport terminals &#8212; your social brand story can change just as quickly. Topics change, the words used to describe your brand shift, and social vernacular morphs.</p>\n<p>The data can (and should) be your canary in a coal mine. By setting and forgetting, you miss out on opportunities to change the conversations around your brand, as they’re actually happening.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em;\">One of our clients, for example, recently ran a </span>campaign through social<span style=\"font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em;\">. Things were going as planned until some participants found a loophole in the contest rules and started ‘gaming the system.’ This brand not only monitored these conversations, they also rounded up their internal teams to turn around an updated set of rules within 24 hours. By listening and taking real-time actions, the company prevented a potentially brand-damaging incident.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em;\">Lesson here: use your social data, engage with it, follow it down the rabbit hole &#8212; don’t just turn it on and watch the pretty charts and graphs.</span></p>\n<h3>Myth 3: Social Media Listening Is Just for [Insert Dept. Here]</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If social media listening is used to serve a singular organizational department, you’re wasting your money on a listening solution. Every minute, millions of conversations are taking place; the insights you can glean from the mass of these conversations can support multiple departments across the organization.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">From a PR standpoint, listening can help you identify potential brand-damaging moments and determine if actions need to be taken.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">From a service perspective, listening can give you insights into how to provide better experiences for your customers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>For product development, listening can identify potential opportunities for product improvements.</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This sharing of listening insights will act as the needle that threads together the cubes and floors of your firm, creating corporate partnerships that span the entire enterprise.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 1.17em; line-height: 1.5em;\">So yes, you can build your social media strategy around myths…</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5em;\">You can ask for a report after a crisis has passed, “listen” for how much earned media a campaign generated, find a few influencers to send swag to, etc. But if that’s the most you’re doing with social listening, you’re selling yourself short. Social has evolved. The expectations of today’s social consumers have evolved. If you want to provide the best experience for your customers/audience, your social listening has to evolve, as well.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sprinklr.com/social-media-compliance-whitepaper/\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-105168\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Enterprise-Social-Compliance-CTA-graphic.png\" alt=\"Enterprise-Social-Compliance-CTA-graphic\" width=\"735\" height=\"250\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>About the Author: </strong><a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/colinmburns\">Colin Burns</a> is an Account Director at Sprinklr and works side-by-side with strategic and Fortune 500 clients to grow their social media presence to scale.

The entry method: Selfie.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h3>The play-by-play:</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-10051\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/castrol-edge-super-bowl-ticket-blitz.jpg\" alt=\"castrol edge super bowl ticket blitz\" width=\"100%\" height=\"403\" /></p>\n<p> Every morning, clues to iconic locations in NY, NJ and Connecticut were revealed on Fox 5’s Good Day NY, as well as Castrol’s social channels. To further amplify the campaign, Castrol leveraged its network of NFL influencers — like Adrian Peterson of the Minnesota Vikings, who personally invited his 2 million fans to join the scavenger hunt.</p>\n<p>The brand also added a human aspect to the experience, with Castrol EDGE brand ambassadors engaging fans directly at that day’s locations to explain the contest and encourage participation.</p>\n<p>While this was all taking place, Castrol’s social team used Sprinklr to monitor, listen and respond to social conversations in real time from a digital Command Center.</p>\n<h3>How Castrol&#8217;s social campaign accomplished business goals:</h3>\n<p>There were more than 5,000 sweepstakes entries, 370 million impressions, 200,000 social interactions, plus 6,500 new fans across Facebook, Twitter and Instagram … not to mention the 20 very excited winners.</p>\n<p>Beyond the basic numbers, Castrol’s campaign also succeeded in managing the customer experience, ensuring that those who engaged with them through social were being heard.</p>\n<p>An example of this occurred on the third day of the contest when a hiccup arose. Castrol’s Command Center team noticed conversations about a loophole in the contest rules. Some participants were “gaming the system” by submitting more than one photo. Others soon took to social to voice their concerns about the game no longer being fair.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-10045\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/castrol-changes-its-rules.jpg\" alt=\"castrol edge super bowl ticket blitz\" width=\"100%\" height=\"625\" /></p>\n<p>In less than 24 hours, Castrol rounded up its legal counsel, changed the rules and informed the community of the revisions. Their fans certainly appreciated it. By listening and taking real-time actions, Castrol prevented a potentially brand-damaging disaster and made their audience members feel heard and appreciated.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sprinklr.com/crisis-management/\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-105064\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Crisis-Management-CTA-graphic.jpg\" alt=\"Crisis-Management-CTA-graphic\" width=\"735\" height=\"250\" /></a></p>\n",

Here’s the text of the “official” press release.</p>\n<h2>Sprinklr Acquires Dachis Group</h2>\n<h3>Creates Largest Independent Social Relationship Platform for the Enterprise</h3>\n<p>NEW YORK, New York &#8212; February 19, 2014 &#8212; Sprinklr, the leading provider of Social Relationship Infrastructure, announced that it has acquired Austin, Texas-based Dachis Group, the leader in social and brand analytics. The combination creates the world’s largest independent enterprise social relationship platform. Together, the two companies have raised over $95 million in venture capital, acquired 11 companies, including three of the original 14 Facebook Preferred Marketing Developers, and served over 50% of the Fortune 500.</p>\n<p>Large brands and agencies require a complete social relationship infrastructure that helps them manage social experiences at every touchpoint. With this acquisition, Sprinklr has added best-in-class brand analytics, content optimization, and employee advocacy to an offering already called “the most powerful technology on the market” by Forrester Research.</p>\n<p>The native integration of Dachis Group will solidify Sprinklr as the largest independent end-to-end social relationship platform in the market. The solution gives enterprises a best-in-class alternative to managing a multitude of point solutions and non-purpose built platforms.</p>\n<p>“Our clients are frustrated with having to play the role of system integrator to cobble together multiple point solutions or waiting for innovation from large providers” said Sprinklr Founder and CEO, Ragy Thomas. “Brands are looking for one infrastructure to manage end-to-end social experiences. The addition of Dachis Group’s technology accelerates our product by at least 12 months.”</p>\n<p>“Our clients have been demanding a real-time social solution that gives them the ability to gain insights, take action anywhere within the enterprise and measure effectiveness,” said Dachis Group Founder and CEO, Jeff Dachis. “Ragy’s clear vision for how enterprises will manage social experiences at every touchpoint, along with Sprinklr’s deep enterprise experience and extensive client and analyst validation, confirms that this was the right transaction to build on our longstanding vision for the evolution of social business.”</p>\n<p>Paul Haskell, Social Commerce and Emerging Media Manager at Omaha Steaks, a mutual client, added, “This is a great fit. Relying on separate systems for gathering insights and taking action is not a sustainable model, especially with the quick pace of social media. This news is very exciting because it brings together those two important functions &#8212; greatly improving the user’s ability to work smarter and faster.”</p>\n<p>The Dachis Group technology will be fully integrated into the existing Sprinklr platform within the next 3 months. Dachis Group’s industry-leading social solutions services team has over 4 years of enterprise strategy consulting experience in social marketing, social customer care, and social selling. The talent, processes, and best practices of Dachis Group will become part of Sprinklr’s growing services enablement practice for its growing partner eco-system.</p>\n<p>With the acquisition, Sprinklr will serve over 400 brands and have 300 employees around the world. Sprinklr’s headquarters are in New York, with offices in London, Delhi, Mumbai and Austin.</p>\n<p><strong>About Sprinklr:</strong> Sprinklr is how brands manage the social experience across internal business unit silos.

It permeates all levels and functions across the enterprise.<!--more--></p>\n<h2 style=\"padding-top: 20px; line-height: 125%;\">Why all the fuss about being a social business? Is it really such a big deal?</h2>\n<p>This isn’t hype. For starters, social business transformation offers three significant benefits:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Employee Engagement:</strong> Motivated, happy employees create happy customers. Their voice (i.e. content) is the marketing. The culture is the brand. When employees are empowered, tech-enabled and actively encouraged to engage through social, they become the company’s strongest advocates.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Enterprise-wide Collaboration:</strong> Social business success is defined by carving your own ecosystem, a network of networks, via:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Activating branded communities across social channels.</li>\n<li>Identifying brand advocates– internal and external.</li>\n<li>Building social capital, influence and thought leadership.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Social business puts the vital framework of technology and social relationships in place, which enables collaboration at scale.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Smarter Information Management:</strong> In a network of social business relationships, an idea for innovation, a new project, or a customer lead can come from anyone, anywhere, 24/7. An open “receive and share” culture optimizes resources (knowledge, talent, content) and streamlines business processes leading to marked improvements in productivity, problem-solving, insight generation and customer service.</p>\n<p>According to ExactTarget’s <a href=\"http://www.exacttarget.com/blog/98-of-global-marketers-increasing-or-maintaining-digital-spend/\" target=\"_blank\">2014 State of Marketing</a> survey, more than 60% of CMOs plan to increase spending on data/analytics and marketing automation technology this year. Social business is the evolution of social media, a logical next step for your business.</p>\n<h2>How do we get started? Where does social business begin?</h2>\n<p>Social business is a marathon, not a sprint. The transformation begins on the inside and gradually grows out. For that to happen, basically you need:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Social Infrastructure: For social relationships to flourish, a good, scalable infrastructure is critical. Your social technology should seamlessly integrate key functions (marketing, sales, CRM, IT, HR, R&amp;D, CX), analyze data across various touch points via social listening, and intuitively generate insights from customer intelligence.</li>\n<li>Social Employees: Training and empowering employees to leverage social technology should be embedded into workflows within the enterprise, community and beyond. While relationship-building skills are paramount, a flair for strategy, analytics and content marketing are invaluable as well. A good place to start would be to appoint a social strategist.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In a nutshell, social business is about future-proofing your business. It could be the difference between survival and extinction.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sprinklr.com/social-media-compliance-whitepaper/\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-105168\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Enterprise-Social-Compliance-CTA-graphic.png\" alt=\"Enterprise-Social-Compliance-CTA-graphic\" width=\"735\" height=\"250\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>About the Author: </strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Mr_Madness\" target=\"_blank\">Amar Trivedi</a> is a Management Strategy Consultant with international experience in Marketing and Communications across cultures, markets and brands.

From 30 clients (two years ago), <strong>we are now serving over 350 of the world’s most social, global brands</strong> including Intel, Cisco, Hearst, Virgin America, Dell, Microsoft, Samsung, Intercontinental Hotels Group, and 800Flowers.com</p>\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 135%; margin-top: 30px;\">In the face of this type of hypergrowth, how does a social start-up maintain a sense of mission, focus, and core values?</h3>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">At Sprinklr, we believe that the arrival of social means that large brands, the companies we serve, must scale real, human relationship or they will simply fail. The same goes for us as we hit escape velocity.</span></p>\n<p>Here’s how we are tackling it&#8230;</p>\n<h2 style=\"line-height: 125%; margin-top: 20px;\">Institutionalizing Culture… and Making It Social</h2>\n<p>Just like our innovative clients, we recognize that <strong>we live in a conversation economy</strong>. The days of a CEO just making pronouncements are over. We need to involve our employees in the conversation and listen to them in order to co-create the culture.</p>\n<p>The arrival of social tools and networks is fundamentally changing every aspect of how organizations deal with customers, partners and community. And the way a company builds and maintains its culture as it grows is no exception.</p>\n<p>In other words, we have to make the institutions and programs of our culture social.</p>\n<h2 style=\"line-height: 125%; margin-top: 20px;\">Make Meetings Social</h2>\n<p>In a recent All-Hands meeting, the entire focus was on our culture and core values. <strong>Our CEO listed our 5 core values:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>It’s OK (to make mistakes as long as you learn and grow from them)</li>\n<li>Sprinkle, don’t shout.<br />\n(It’s not about who yells the loudest or who hoots the loudest. It’s about who offers the most value in a relevant, nurturing way. You don’t drown your lawn w/water, you sprinkle it.)</li>\n<li>Fix, don’t complain.</li>\n<li>Never, ever give up.</li>\n<li>Passionately, genuinely care.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As our CEO went through each value and WHY it was a value, we encouraged attendees to both tweet out the value AND to offer comments for their network.</p>\n<p>When all was said and done, we had 68% participation and generated almost 300 tweets …and that doesn’t even include the re-tweets by others, such as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/edwardboches/status/351788721651187713\">Edward Boches</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jowyang/status/351746940632965123\">Jeremiah Owyang</a>.</p>\n<h2 style=\"line-height: 125%; margin-top: 20px;\">Make The Company Vocabulary Social</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">If you search for the hashtag </span><a style=\"font-size: 13px;\" href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23believeitis&amp;src=typd\">#believeitis</a><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">, you’ll see a lot of activity from Sprinklrites.

We know that clients connect with people they like…and our people are really likeable, so we profile them.

We’ve invited John Moore (formerly of Brand Autopsy and now of Brains on Fire) to give a webinar.  We also spent time with Jeremiah Owyang and he shared some of the most powerful words we had to consider:</p>\n<p>&#8220;Culture is what you do when no one else is looking.</p>\n<p>Culture matters more than products. Why? All companies will have product fails… startups, even more so… what a company does after the fail matters most. They can fail backward by blaming each other… or fail forward and innovate together. ”</p>\n<h2 style=\"line-height: 125%; margin-top: 20px;\">Invest in Culture Now</h2>\n<p>In the past year, Sprinklr has successfully emerged from the start-up pack to become the leading provider of social relationship infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Now, we’re battling and winning against multi-billion dollar software giants.</p>\n<p>We know we can’t outspend them and we can’t outshout them, but we can out-innovate and out-deliver them… but only if we get our culture right.</p>\n<p>There will be challenges ahead, so we’re investing today… in a uniquely social way.<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\"> </span></p>\n<p><strong>About the Author:</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jer979\">Jeremy Epstein</a> is VP of Marketing at Sprinklr.

We’ve taken a 7-day snapshot (January 9-15, 2014) that captured data ranking and showcasing the social media analytics of the best performing airlines in social media.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a look at who’s winning in social in the airline industry.</p>\n<p><b>American Airlines is the most social airline</b></p>\n<p>American Airlines comes in at number one overall with a score of 64 out of 69 total points, with the most impressions per post (impressions ratio) by far. They also earn the most engagement for each piece of content they post (content engagement ratio), and a strong showing in terms of of engagement per follower (engagement ratio). These scores demonstrate that American is not just relying on its large audience, but is also producing content that effectively triggers a consumer response.</p>\n<p>American engages audiences on many topics, from flight delay updates to beautiful images of their airplanes and the cities to which they fly. They promote the latest movies and television shows being shown on long flights, share fun facts such as how long it takes paint to dry on a widebody plane, and their latest travel promotions. Their Facebook posts tend to garner thousands of likes, long comment threads, and hundreds of shares from plane enthusiasts as well as travel lovers.<br />\n<!--more (read me...)--><br />\n<a href=\"/?page_id=1752\"><img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/CTA-graphic-opt2.jpg\" alt=\"CTA-graphic-opt2\" width=\"735\" height=\"85\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-105443\" /></a><br />\nAfter American Airlines, US Airways, United, Delta, and Alaska Airlines come in with strong scores as well. Alaska Airlines has a notably high content engagement ratio of 35.808, the highest by far amongst the top 10 overall.</p>\n<p><b>American has the most reach, with KLM and Southwest close behind</b></p>\n<p>When it comes to reach (impressions), American Airlines tops the list again. This means that they have achieved an ideal combination of producing good quality content to an engaged audience, yielding a high number of impressions. Our software measures not only the direct impressions a brand’s content generates, but also successive impressions that come from earned media. This approach takes into account both effect of social sharing and the quality of a brand’s audience.</p>\n<p>KLM, Southwest, Delta, and Virgin America rank next. KLM has an active follower base, with content that includes witty copy, light-hearted topics, and beautiful imagery.</p>\n<p>American also wins in impressions per post (impressions ratio), which measures the awareness that has been generated for a brand based on the propagation of a brand&#8217;s content through owned and earned media. Audience size is factored out of the measure, so that brands don&#8217;t rank high simply because of their existing follower base. </p>\n<p>US Airways, Delta, Virgin and United rank next.</p>\n<p><b>Emirates is the most engaging airline</b></p>\n<p>One of the most critical pieces to the puzzle of social marketing success, engagement demonstrates how active audiences are in connecting with the brands they love. Emirates came in at number one for engagement levels, which means they succeed at entertaining and eliciting action from their audience.</p>\n<p>Owned by the government of Dubai&#8217;s investment arm, Emirates’ often promotes the success and growth of the city of Dubai and the United Arab Emirates. They showcase deals, engage with consumers through quizzes and shared community photos, and publish eye-catching images of their airplanes.</p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em\"></span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;text-align: center\">KLM, American Airlines, Lufthansa, and Delta followed.</span></p>\n<p>Content engagement ratio is a measure of how well a brand’s content is resonating with its audience. It is calculated by measuring the average number of social actions per brand post. Audience size is factored out of the measure, so that brands don’t rank high simply because of their follower base. Alaska Airlines is the top performer, with Emirates, Singapore Airlines, Qantas and American following.</p>\n<p><b>Methodology </b></p>\n<p>Dachis Group leaderboards look at five metrics when calculating social performance: audience count, post count, impressions, participation, and engagement. We also look at engagement numbers per audience size (engagement ratio), and the average social actions per post (content engagement ratio). While a brand might be great at attracting a large audience, they might not be as good at engaging with that audience or frequently posting content. On the other hand, a brand could have a small audience, but be committed to engaging with that targeted group of people.</p>\n<p><b>Track your brand against competitors</b></p>\n<p>Customizable brand leaderboards are easy-to-use, straightforward indicators of how brands stack up against competitors in terms of audience reach, engagement, participation, and more.</p>\n<p>Many of the world’s largest brands are using Dachis Group’s social analytics software to understand their performance in the social marketing space, make improvements, and see real results.

I love seeing photos of friends and figuring out how to use this powerful channel as an opportunity to build a brand&#8217;s community. However, I think anyone out there who runs a Facebook page for a brand has been frustrated to see a huge drop in fan impressions as Facebook is making the &#8220;pay to play&#8221; message very clear. If you&#8217;re ready to embrace this new way of thinking, then let&#8217;s chat about how to do it successfully… and how to avoid the confusing messages out there.</span></p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h3>Fiction #1: Use the Boost Post button below your post. It&#8217;s easy and efficient!</h3>\n<p>Fact: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ads/manage/powereditor/\">Power Editor</a> might be confusing, but it’s far better for promoting posts. If you want to get the most out of your promoted post, create a new campaign in Power Editor, create an ad in that campaign, and watch your post get a ton more eyeballs. Start thinking of your post as an ad. That&#8217;s how Facebook looks at it, and the word &#8220;sponsored&#8221; will show up to many of your fans when they see your post. Using the “Boost Post” button does not provide as many targeting options and sometimes won&#8217;t even work properly in getting more impressions.</p>\n<h3>Fiction #2: Promoting a post on Facebook is expensive and does not get a lot of impressions.</h3>\n<p>Fact: If you set up the ad correctly, you can get tens of thousands of impressions with a few hundred dollars. Try small dollar amounts first to see what works best. You will be pleased with the cost efficiency of promoted posts (even if you&#8217;re still annoyed you have to pay to promote to your own fans, ha!).</p>\n<h3>Fiction #3: Your promoted posts will ONLY get angry comments and won&#8217;t be beneficial to your brand.</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Fact: To build positive engagement on your posts, you will be safest promoting only to fans. Since many brands are only reaching 5-15% of their fan base, you still have a lot of growth with your biggest promoters. If you go outside of your fan base, prepare yourself for negative comments. However, if you target your post to the right audience and ensure that there is a benefit for them, you will greatly decrease complaints. Promote to non-fans only when appropriate. A person&#8217;s Newsfeed is sacred territory..  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Hope these few pointers will get you started on promoting your next amazing post. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll have some other questions in Power Editor, so maybe that&#8217;s for another blog.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><a href=\"https://www.sprinklr.com/social-paid-whitepaper/\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-104970\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Paid-Social-CTA-graphic.jpg\" alt=\"Paid-Social-CTA-graphic\" width=\"735\" height=\"250\" /></a> </span></p>\n<p><strong>About the Author: </strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bonniecruice\">Bonnie Cruice</a> is the Creative Social Manager for Vanguard.

When done correctly, interactions of this type increase engagement, boost earned media, and help humanize large brands.</p>\n<p>Large organizations are constantly striving to be more engaging in social channels. They see the potential for earned media to offer transformational marketing benefits, but they struggle to be more than an outlet for company news and generic stock photos. Real-time marketing is a business practice that uses the conversations and activity of the market, consumers, and critical constituents to inform production of relevant and timely content. When brand content is rooted in this model, marketers can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Become a source of trending news and content</li>\n<li>Publically demonstrate a customer service commitment</li>\n<li>Connect to seasonal events and trends</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our latest white paper outlines case studies from 6 major brands (<strong>Nissan, CitiBike, Absolut, WestJet, Xerox, and AT&amp;T</strong>) that are achieving these outcomes through salient real-time marketing tactics.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s an example of what&#8217;s inside our new white paper:</p>\n<h4><b><i>Absolut uses a local, current event to produce creative content</i></b><b> </b></h4>\n<div style=\"width: 602px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img src=\"http://5ptz.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/5POINTZ_HOME_BANNER_1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"592\" height=\"282\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">5 Points NYC</p></div>\n<h5><b>Objective:</b></h5>\n<p><b></b>Absolut Vodka has a longstanding affiliation with the arts, and uses its social presences to align its brand with the art world. It made sense as an extension of that branding for Absolut to connect with the street art community as it processed the demise of the famed 5 Pointz graffiti park in New York.</p>\n<h5><b>Action:</b></h5>\n<p><b></b>The spirits brand has an active Twitter presence, heavily focused on its involvement with visual arts and collaborations with the art community. The brand’s print advertising has long been praised for its creativity and artistic nature, and its social presence is a natural extension of that concept. (See #OpenCanvas, #TransformToday, #TransformBasel) So, in the wake of 5 Pointz’s closing, Absolut tweeted a simple image that memorialized the site.</p>\n<p><b style=\"font-size: 0.83em;\">Result:</b></p>\n<p>The tweet yielded [117 retweets and 64 favorites], a substantial increase in engagement from the brand’s typical tweets (usually 1-10 retweets and 0-5 favorites). The success of this real-time tweet demonstrates the inclination of consumers and brand audiences to more readily engage with brand content when it is relevant and timely – especially when the brand has a longstanding voice in the context of a given trend.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\">Aligning your brand with the right trends</h4>\n<p>The brands we’ve looked at have determined practical ways to engage with audiences in real-time. They constantly seek ways to improve these tactics, in order to enhance their brand perception and audience engagement. In aligning their content with trending topics, powerful stories, and relevant concepts, their brands are revitalized and more than just a business. It’s a new way to build brands, and now is the time for your team to get started.</p>\n<p>Download a copy of &#8220;How 6 Brands Are Leading the Real-Time Marketing Charge&#8221; to learn how brands like Xerox, AT&amp;T, Absolut and Nissan have implemented real-time strategies that enable them to produce timely content and engage with audiences.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sprinklr.com/customer-experience-ebook/\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-106004\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Download-Ebook-CXM-CTA-graphic.jpg\" alt=\"Get our Customer Experience eBook\" width=\"735\" height=\"250\" /></a></p>\n",

In addition to long car rides and overeating, consumers will be searching for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=cranberry%20sauce&amp;src=typd\" target=\"_blank\">cranberry sauce</a> deals on Twitter, browsing <a href=\"http://www.mediabistro.com/alltwitter/social-thanksgiving-facts_b31513\" target=\"_blank\">Pintrest for green bean recipes</a>, and using Facebook to watch viral videos of cats dressed as turkeys. It’s an important time of the year for brand marketers to be engaging with their advocates and audiences on every social media platform, wherever the trends are driving their attention. As we discovered last year in our analysis of social discussions surrounding Black Friday, these social platforms have become the primary online medium for brand-to-consumer, and consumer-to-consumer conversations, especially during high seasons of consumer activity. During the most hectic retail period of the year, consumers turn to social media to learn, engage, and share.</p>\n<p>Brand marketers use social to constantly promote and share deals and information during holidays and events like Thanksgiving, and can also determine the <a href=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/nashville/blog/2013/10/holiday-shopping-with-social-media-is.html?page=all\" target=\"_blank\">effectiveness of their advertising in real time</a>. As national retailers spend millions of dollars on holiday advertising, they don&#8217;t have to wait until sales numbers come in to determine whether or not the ads were effective.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/?page_id=1752\"><img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/CTA-graphic-opt2.jpg\" alt=\"CTA-graphic-opt2\" width=\"735\" height=\"85\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-105443\" /></a></p>\n<p>Discount shopping, airline delays and overeating are undoubtedly going to be among the trending topics of the week. We can expect brands in those spaces to be engaging with their audiences at higher levels than usual. Last year, <a href=\"http://blog.instagram.com/post/36359968655/thanksgiving-day-on-instagram\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram reported that over 10 million photos</a> mentioned Thanksgiving-themed words in their captions on Thanksgiving day, with more than 200 photos posted every second. The company shared that it was “excited to see the intimacy and immediacy of the Instagram experience…over the holiday season.” People celebrate Thanksgiving in real time, and brands need to be there engaging right alongside them.</p>\n<p>There are also ways for brands outside the food, retail and airline industries to promote themselves in a time-sensitive, real-time way without looking desperate. Think of it this way: the companies behind television ads don’t have to be directly applicable to the program they are sponsoring, so engagement with trends and consumers doesn’t have to be either. It just needs to be done well.<br />\n<!--more (read me...)--><br />\nFind ways to track the conversations and trends of your audience, using tools like Dachis Group’s <a href=\"http://www.socialbusinessindex.com/company/dachisgroup#17\" target=\"_blank\">Brand Trend Dashboard</a>, to tap into the real time conversations of those consumers who matter to you. Consumers interact with brands via social networks every day to gather information, share feedback, or advocate. Use the trends surrounding Thanksgiving as a moment to insert yourself into their conversations.</p>\n<p>Here are some Thanksgiving real time marketing ideas for any brand marketer this year.</p>\n<h3>Use employees as real time marketing collateral</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Employees can be an unbelievable compliment to your marketing strategy, as we’ve outlined in the past in our white paper: <a href=\"https://www.sprinklr.com/employee-advocacy-whitepaper/\">10 Steps to Successful Employee Advocacy</a>.</li>\n<li>Have your employees share what they are thankful for on your company’s social networks or using a specific hashtag.</li>\n<li>Encourage employees to take pictures of their turkeys that you’ll be able to share via company pages or communal hashtags, in real time.</li>\n<li>Use these photos to create a Facebook album for post-Thanksgiving social action.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Be Thankful</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>#GiveThanks: Connect your brand to being thankful and find interesting ways to engage with consumers directly.</li>\n<li>Does your company have a charity that it supports? Use this as an opportunity to support and engage with the charity’s social networks.</li>\n<li>Highlight volunteer and charitable efforts of your company over the last year, and invite your audience to do the same.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Engage With Thanksgiving Events</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Thanksgiving Day Parade: The live, nationally broadcasted event is certain to get real-time conversations going about favorite floats, marching bands and funny things that Al Roker says. Follow along and engage with your audience! Why not live tweet the parade with funny commentary?</li>\n<li>Football, football, football. Chances are, your employees and consumers are watching the big games on Thanksgiving (or hanging out with people who are). Find out who everyone is rooting for!</li>\n<li>Black Friday: Who has a funny Black Friday story? Do your consumers like the new ‘early-bird’ offering? (And what about your employees?) Get the conversations going with easy-to-find hashtags that directly engage consumers.</li>\n<li>Travel: everyone is travelling somewhere on Thanksgiving – come up with some handy travel tips for your consumers, from air travel advice to car games for the long rides.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Brand marketers no longer need to wait for their audience members to tune into ABC on Wednesdays at 8; they just need to follow the same trends that their audience members are following every single day, seven days a week. And during major holidays and events like Thanksgiving, those conversations are expected to increase dramatically. Find your audiences, and connect with them in real time!<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.sprinklr.com/social-paid-whitepaper/\"><img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Paid-Social-CTA-graphic.jpg\" alt=\"Paid-Social-CTA-graphic\" width=\"735\" height=\"250\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-104970\" /></a></p>\n",

              "rendered": "<p>Real-time analytics paired with real-time marketing tactics have the potential to transform the way brands participate in global cultural events. The transformation of media triggered by social, mobile, and ubiquitous connectivity, means a brand with a savvy creative approach and a strong grasp of real-time marketing can now introduce wholly new tactics to attach their brand to major events. This blog post will explain how to make it happen.</p>\n<h2>Real-Time Marketing at Events like the World Cup and Super Bowl</h2>\n<p>Brands pay <a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.com/how-much-do-super-bowl-commercials-cost-ad-prices-continue-rise-still-bargain-1057574\">$4,000,000 to purchase 30 seconds of commercial time</a> during the Super Bowl and <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-17/final-soccer-world-cup-sponsor-to-spend-50-million-in-15-months.html\">tens of millions of dollars to sponsor the World Cup or the Olympics</a>. But what if there was a way to get more value out of an event sponsorship, or to even become part of that event without sponsoring it at all?</p>\n<p>Global sports and athletes have never been more popular, and as a result brands spend huge sums to be part of massive cultural events like the NFL Playoffs or the Olympics. Yet, the focus of consumer attention is no longer just a television broadcast, but also the hashtags, videos, comments, and links that millions of viewers engage with throughout the event. According to the <a href=\"http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/newswire/2013/action-figures--how-second-screens-are-transforming-tv-viewing.html\">latest Nielsen survey</a> of connected device owners, nearly half of smartphone owners (46%) and tablet owners (43%) said they use their devices as second screens while watching TV every day. This creates an opportunity for nimble brands to become a part of global events by using timely social and digital marketing tactics that can influence, or even hijack, the conversation surrounding a sporting event.</p>\n<h3>Precedents for Brand&#8217;s Seizing the Spot Light</h3>\n<p>First, let&#8217;s address the question &#8211; is it even possible to build a digital program that closely ties your brand to a major event in ways that are more meaningful than an on-field logo or in-game commercial? The answer is yes, there is ample precedent for this ranging from Nike at the last World Cup, to Doritos every year at the Super Bowl, and Oreo at the most recent Super Bowl.</p>\n<p>The key is to combine compelling digital content, with ongoing  adaptive and timely tactics that align to the breaking news of the event.</p>\n<h3>Compelling digital content: Nike&#8217;s 2010 World Cup digital campaign</h3>\n<p>As we saw in the 2010 World Cup, with Nike&#8217;s digital video campaigns, and then again during this year&#8217;s Super Bowl with the various attempts at real-time, there is an opportunity for brands to become a part of the atmosphere of these major events, without necessarily (or in addition to) spending huge sums of money on event sponsorship and advertising.</p>\n<p>Nike was not an official sponsor of the 2010 World Cup, but you&#8217;d never know it based on the effectiveness of their digital marketing tactics. Look back at the coverage of the event and you can see the degree to which Nike was able to build a dominant position surrounding the event with tactical digital executions like their use of sponsored athletes and digital video.</p>\n<h3>Ongoing relevance: Doritos Crash the Super Bowl Campaigns</h3>\n<p>Every year brands release portions of their Super Bowl commercials in teasers and hints in the days coming up to the event. But only Doritos really makes a long-running event out of their commercials. Their contest, with its rounds of voting and constant change, keeps the brand&#8217;s audience involved for the duration of the event.</p>\n<p>Pursuing ongoing relevance has the benefit of not only broadening appeal beyond the audience that solely watches the big game itself. It also creates more opportunities for brands to attach to timely trends while widening the window for timely executions. It&#8217;s a lot easier to do timely marketing on a 48 hour timetable, than real-time marketing on a 4 minute time table.</p>\n<h3>The power of timeliness: Mini&#8217;s Burger Controversy Campaign</h3>\n<p>Similarly, look at <a href=\"http://www.adweek.com/news/television/mini-cooper-s-brilliant-take-horse-meat-152299\">Mini&#8217;s use of timely content</a> in the context of the burger meat scandals in the UK. They launched a piece of timely digital content within days of the news breaking, and then extended and optimized the campaign across channels as it resonated with their target audience.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 329px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img class=\"     \" alt=\"Mini joined the horsemeat conversation in the UK\" src=\"http://www.adweek.com/files/fea-rtm-viral-01-2013.jpg\" width=\"319\" height=\"561\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mini&#8217;s horsemeat campaign. Image via AdWeek</p></div>\n<p>So, what does this mean for the future?</p>\n<p>Brands that want to dominate the digital conversation alongside major events can design programs that are built to thrive in a world of more timely and real-time conversation.</p>\n<p>Multi-day cultural events (like the NFL Playoffs for example) are the perfect place for brands to speed up and elevate their timely marketing. It is relatively easy to identify the trends and news that matters using existing technology. The relevancy window where a brand can say something is much longer than a single game &#8211; so brands can move quickly, but not quite in real-time and still be successful.</p>\n<p>In the future brands will borrow the Nike strategy of guerrilla digital marketing, link it to the Frito strategy of layered digital execution, and add in a 3rd piece: timely, responsive content in order to become the dominant brand in the context of major events.</p>\n<h3>How to Do Real-Time Marketing at Multi-Day Events</h3>\n<p>To get started with real-time marketing at major events, brands need to embrace some new technology, and some new process, but much of this can be done with existing resources and capabilities.</p>\n<h3>Establish a flexible creative platform and associated guidelines</h3>\n<p>This platform will be the foundation of all of your tactics surrounding the event &#8211; both planned and timely. This is critical because the guidelines for which event storylines and trends to join, as well as how to join them will flow from the brand values and creative platform you&#8217;ve already established. Having these rules in place will speed up your execution substantially. Make sure you can quickly answer questions like:</p>\n<p>Is this a trend we should join? What tone should we take? What assets do we have? What call to action should we focus on? Is it compliant / legal? What are the specific roles and responsibilities for creative development, approval, publishing and measurement? How will we align our paid media budgets to these tactics? etc.</p>\n<h3>Implement the technology, team, and process to adapt the creative platform in a timely way.</h3>\n<p>This breaks down into three stages. You will need to identify trends, join trends, and then measure/optimize your efforts. Some of this is technology enabled, and some of it is just old fashioned project management, but sped up substantially.</p>\n<h3>Identifying trends</h3>\n<p>Use a combination of software and your creative platform guidelines to identify the narratives and content from the event that are trending among your target demographics. These will give you the raw materials for trend attachment.</p>\n<p>Dachis Group&#8217;s software finds the topics and content trending among your specific target segments in real-time (men who love soccer for example) so that you can know the most fruitful areas to build content and participate in the conversations.</p>\n<h3>Joining trends</h3>\n<p>Once a trend is identified, you must rapidly create content, get it approved internally, publish it and promote it. This will typically be the responsibility of a joint brand/agency team who can work together to filter through ideas and actually make the creative assets necessary for publication. Because this effort will take place in a timely (though not quite real-time manner) you won&#8217;t need the huge team in one room that Oreo had for its famous Tweet from the Super Bowl. But make no mistake, this will require smooth and rapid hand offs between a number of parties &#8211; we recommend practicing well in advance. </p>\n<p>Dachis Group can help with specific training and guidelines that make it easy for your brand to rapidly develop and implement content.</p>\n<h3>Measuring and optimizing participation.</h3>\n<p>Most of the events you choose to join are long lasting and occur in bursts over the course of weeks. For example, the NFL Playoffs occur over more than a month. This affords brands the unique opportunity to experiment with tactics, track their effectiveness, and optimize for the next round of content.</p>\n<p>Real-time analytics that track very specific audience reactions, content performance, earned media performance are critical to ensure an optimized program. This will also help you to understand which content is resonating and may be appropriate to extend into other channels &#8211; even traditional media as we saw with Mini&#8217;s burger controversy campaign.</p>\n<p>Dachis Group software helps you optimize with a number of analytics dashboards that report on competitive brand performance, content effectiveness, and earned media performance &#8211; all in real-time.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Inserting your brand into the conversations surrounding major cultural events has never been easier or more valuable. The World Cup, Super Bowl, Nascar and countless other events no longer play out solely on the pitch or track, they play out in real-time conversations on Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr and YouTube. Is your brand ready?</p>\n",

By occupying space, you just create noise. But by analyzing the end users and creating meaningful human experiences and interactions in their daily digital consumption, you create relationships. This is called Human Centered Design (HCD) and it is key to modern marketing.<br />\n<!--more (read me...)--></p>\n<h3>What is Human Centered Design?</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">HCD is a process and a set of techniques used to create new solutions for the world. Solutions include: products, services, environments, organizations, and modes of interaction.</span></p>\n<p>The reason this process is called “human-centered” is because it starts with the people we design for. The HCD process begins by examining the needs, dreams, and behaviors of the people we want to affect with our solutions. We seek to listen to and understand what they want. We call this the “desirability lens.” We view the world through this lens throughout the design process.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-9080\" title=\"HCD-lenses \" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/different-HCD-lenses.jpg\" alt=\"Human Centered Design lenses \" width=\"486\" height=\"466\" /></p>\n<p>Once we have identified a range of what is desirable, we begin to view our solutions through the lenses of “feasibility” and “viability.” We carefully bring in these lenses during the later phases of the process.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">The three phases of HCD are: Hear, Create, and Deliver.</span></strong></p>\n<h3>HEAR</h3>\n<p>Traditionally, a group of people — whether agency or internal — go directly to brainstorming and creating. But in a modern approach, listening must happen before anything else.</p>\n<p><strong>Listen and Understand:</strong> First, you must analyze the audience. What are their personas? What are they talking about? How have past campaigns performed?</p>\n<p><strong>Feedback and Collaboration:</strong> In this phase, it is critical that you talk with end-users (either in a group or individual setting), learn their stories, and understand how they consume. This allows you to know the needs, barriers, and constraints to your service or product.</p>\n<h3>CREATE</h3>\n<p>In this phase, you start to understand the timeframe, look for patterns, seek opportunities, and create an approach —  always with the voice of the user in mind.</p>\n<p><strong>Develop an Approach:</strong> Take all the knowledge and opportunities identified, and set them into the reality of today. This includes calling out key insights, finding themes, and creating marketing frameworks.</p>\n<p><strong>Create Objectives and Channels:</strong> As you create a plan, remember to not only deliver relevant content (via a multi-channel approach), but also to <a href=\"https://www.sprinklr.com/social-scale-blog/2013/10/15/dont-be-the-conversation-join-the-conversation-2/\">J</a><a href=\"https://www.sprinklr.com/social-scale-blog/2013/10/15/dont-be-the-conversation-join-the-conversation-2/\">OIN THE CONVERSATION</a> in the topic areas where your users are engaging.</p>\n<p><strong>Gather Feedback:</strong> Once solutions have been generated, take them back out to the users to get feedback.</p>\n<h3>DELIVER</h3>\n<p><strong>Launch:</strong> With all these components, you now have a revolutionary user-generated marketing approach.

You rarely think about the materials that hold the house together — the foundation that makes it possible to have a home.</p>\n<p>The same applies to social. You rarely think about the systems in place to make all those tweets, shares, and conversations possible. You overlook the role of infrastructure in building and maintaining relationships.</p>\n<p>But the reality is: &#8220;without an infrastructure, you’re just not social,&#8221; says <a href=\"https://twitter.com/slbroze\">Sonja Broze</a>, Head of Social Relationship Infrastructure at PayPal.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h3>Why the Emphasis on Infrastructure?</h3>\n<p>It’s clear to Sonja, and other leaders at PayPal, that social isn&#8217;t just another platform to push promotional messages onto customers. Rather, it presents an opportunity to converse with them, get to know them, and nurture relationships with them.</p>\n<p>And with 132 million active registered PayPal accounts in 193 markets, the brand has a lot of relationships to maintain. So, they’ve put in place a framework that would integrate their social channels, keep track of conversations worldwide, and provide valuable feedback.</p>\n<p>This is especially helpful as PayPal continues to expand into international markets. Thanks to a robust infrastructure, PayPal knows when their customers need help, and how to take steps to get in touch. And they know this on a global scale.</p>\n<p>An infrastructure empowers companies to “make business decisions by knowing — not just having — customers,” Sonja says.</p>\n<h3> A Bold Prediction</h3>\n<p>Sonja believes enterprises will soon (if they haven’t already) put the same emphasis on building a strong social infrastructure. “Infrastructure isn’t a sexy word,” she says. “But it allows us to stay in touch with those that matter to us most — our customers.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sprinklr.com/customer-experience-ebook/\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-106004\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Download-Ebook-CXM-CTA-graphic.jpg\" alt=\"Get our Customer Experience eBook\" width=\"735\" height=\"250\" /></a></p>\n",

But one Facebook fan had other things on her mind: “Citibank, I need money to buy a house for me in New York. CAN YOU HELP ME??????”<!--more--></p>\n<p>Esther, a Citibank representative, gives the customer the phone number to connect with a mortgage specialist and advises that further questions be shared through a private message to protect her privacy.</p>\n<p>It’s a scenario that repeats itself on the Citibank US Facebook page multiple times each day, regardless if the photo is a baseball player sharing a ballpark promotion or a rock star touting presale ticket access for Citi cardmembers.</p>\n<p>For <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/paulmichaud\">Paul Michaud</a>, Senior Vice President of Social Media at Citi, facing these kind of conversational curveballs is just business as usual.</p>\n<p>“The customer may not consider the context of our wall post,” he says. “Seeing the Citi name might just remind them that they have a question or complaint. And when they get in touch, our customer service team has to be ready to engage with them.”</p>\n<p>“We moderate all of our comments, but for the sake of transparency, we don’t delete any of the negative feedback,” Michaud adds. “The only things we remove are customers’ personal identity information, profanity, completely off-topic material, or spam messages.</p>\n<h3>Taking a peek at Citi’s Global Consumer Banking business, best known as Citibank, is a case study on how financial institutions can be social at scale — while still engaging with customers on a personal level.</h3>\n<p>Citibank serves more than 100 million clients in 40 countries, with about half of their total loans, deposits, revenues, and net income coming from the United States. With more than a million of those customers following its multiple accounts on Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, Citi needed a social relationship infrastructure (SRI) to monitor and respond to the thousands of messages streaming in daily.</p>\n<p>According to Michaud, Citi chose Sprinklr to quickly process and prioritize the fire hose of social media comments, and coordinate who in the company should respond. Although Citi has specific channels devoted to specific purposes — i.e. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AskCiti\">@AskCiti</a> on Twitter is devoted to resolving customer issues on a private line once contact is established — the customer usually makes no such distinctions.</p>\n<p>“We tell our customer service team to be prepared for just about anything,” Michaud says. “We might get a public affairs question, a recruiting question from someone applying for a job, or a vendor trying to find the right internal contact. Occasionally, we may even see crisis-related social conversations.”</p>\n<p>During Hurricane Sandy, Citi posted updates about branch openings, locations of its mobile branches, donations and opportunities to donate, and information on various fee waivers. Customers responded with comments and questions, as well as providing feedback on Citi’s handling of the crisis.</p>\n<p>Whether the social media messages are urgent or routine business, customer service representatives use the Sprinklr SRI to triage the questions to the most appropriate Citi team.</p>\n<h3>Michaud credits the new system for saving roughly 20 percent of his community manager’s time that was previously devoted to customer service issues.</h3>\n<p>The community manager had previously been in the role of liaison between customer service and other departments. That saved time is now used to create more original content and engage with consumers.</p>\n<p>“We like the fact that the Sprinklr team is very entrepreneurial and responsive to our needs,” says Michaud. “Our main focus now is using it to track our performance. We were using an agency to compile metrics and it was very labor-intensive. Now, we’ve shifted their focus from reporting metrics to delivering actionable business insights to improve our strategy.”</p>\n<p>Because all Citi marketing content must be reviewed by the appropriate legal and compliance teams, using an SRI to track the approval of each post is invaluable. The system is also used to catalog and manage the company’s library of licensed images — every photograph posted on social media must be cleared for copyright.</p>\n<p><strong>“Customer service is obviously vital for financial services; and if you’re going to have a brand presence on social media and invite conversation, you’d better be prepared to handle every conversation,”</strong> Michaud says, stressing that Citi social media channels also attract plenty of compliments to balance out the complaints.</p>\n<p>“If you follow our <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CitiPrivatePass\">@CitiPrivatePass</a> handle on Twitter, you’ll see lots of customers who are thrilled to get presale or VIP access to concerts, sports, dining, and family events,” he says.</p>\n<p>“We try our best to treat all of our customers like rock stars,” he adds.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sprinklr.com/social-media-compliance-whitepaper/\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-105168\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Enterprise-Social-Compliance-CTA-graphic.png\" alt=\"Enterprise-Social-Compliance-CTA-graphic\" width=\"735\" height=\"250\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>About the author:</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jer979\" target=\"_blank\">Jeremy Epstein</a> is VP of Marketing at Sprinklr.

              "rendered": "<h2>How To Activate &amp; Manage Athletes in Social Media</h2>\n<p>Whether it&#8217;s through <a href=\"http://www.marketingcharts.com/wp/television/how-much-tv-is-being-time-shifted-26229/\">time-shifting,</a> <a href=\"http://qz.com/120797/over-one-fifth-of-people-use-ad-blocking-software-and-its-beginning-to-hurt/\">ad-blocking</a>, or carefully timed bathroom breaks, consumers have mastered the art of ignoring advertisements. In response, marketers have been turning to athlete endorsers to make their products stand out. And it works: <a href=\"http://www.people.hbs.edu/aelberse/publications/Elberse_Verleun_2012.pdf\">athlete endorsements yield an average 4% increase in sales and a .25% increase in stock value</a>. The rise of social media and the massive attention paid to athletes in social have created a new channel in which athletes can influence consumer behavior and brands can capitalize on endorser opportunities.</p>\n<p>The most effective athlete endorsement campaigns require activation, measurement, and optimization. We pulled the data for a large brand with a well-respected roster of athlete endorsers and discovered that almost 20% of their sponsored, compensated athletes had failed to take a single brand-related social action in more than 6 months. These athletes had a cumulative social audience of more than 15,000,000 subscribers, yet that audience was left untapped for over half of the year.</p>\n<h2>The Social Media Brand / Athlete Imbalance</h2>\n<p>Athletes are vastly more appealing to consumers in social media than the brands they endorse. Nothing affirms this imbalance more clearly than Twitter: the COMBINED Twitter audience for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mcdonalds\">McDonalds</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/starbucks\">Starbucks</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cocacola\">Coca-Cola </a>(7,938,017) is less than half the size of soccer (football) star Cristiano Ronaldo&#8217;s (21,496,784) audience. Other great examples include: Lebron James with nearly 5 times as many followers as Nike, Derrick Rose with more than 4 time as many followers as Adidas, or Roger Federer with 200 times as many followers as Lindt Chocolate.<br />\nAnd this is just the gap in audiences. It doesn&#8217;t begin to account for the credibility difference between content shared on social media by a beloved athlete and content shared by a brand. New technology makes it incredibly easy to activate athletes in social and then calculate the ROI of their activities on behalf of your brand.</p>\n<h2>5 Steps to Maximizing Athlete Endorsements in Social Media</h2>\n<p>Social technology means that athlete endorsements can be more powerful than ever before. They also mean that brands have to learn how to put social endorsement programs in place with their athletes, enforce compliance, and measure ROI. These five steps will get you focused and extracting more value from your athlete endorsements.</p>\n<h3>1. Establish quantitative KPIs</h3>\n<p>The beauty of social media is the abundance of data that comes with it. Take this opportunity to determine a simple set of easily measured performance indicators that you will check on a regular basis. Dachis Group software allows you to easily track an athlete&#8217;s:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Audience size</li>\n<li>Social posting frequency</li>\n<li>Brand-related social posting frequency</li>\n<li>Brand-related earned media / impressions generated</li>\n<li>Clicks generated</li>\n<li>Web visits generated</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2. Benchmark and rank your athletes</h3>\n<p>Rank all of your sponsored athletes (or prospective sponsored athletes) across all of the KPIs in question. Different brands will want to introduce different weightings. Brands with goals for awareness and consideration may weigh earned media impressions most highly in their rankings. Brands with products that can be purchased easily in a digital environment might be especially focused on clicks, or even on shopping cart behavior if analytics allow. The most important thing is to establish these quantitative rankings and track them closely so you can optimize later.</p>\n<h3>3. Activate</h3>\n<p>Coordinate your marketing campaigns with your athletes. Ensure that every athlete is using the correct links, hashtags, and verbiage in support of your brand messaging and campaign. This can be done in an easy, organized manner by using a centralized platform to coordinate activation.</p>\n<h3>4. Measure</h3>\n<p>Use closed loop measurement on content (one of the many benefits of publishing from a centralized platform) to track content performance, clicks, and even website behaviors. Look to understand not only each athlete in a vacuum but also overall contribution in the context of a larger campaign. Often the earned media bonus of sponsored athlete participation in a campaign will rival paid media dollars deployed in social.</p>\n<p>You can also easily calculate an ROI from social participation by applying your typical CPM rates for social advertising to the impressions that athlete participation yields.</p>\n<h3>5. Optimize</h3>\n<p>Using this framework, you can rank any given athlete&#8217;s brand contribution not only on the perceived ROI of your sponsorship but also on the actual earned media benefit the athlete is generating for your brand. Analyze content types that perform well with certain athlete&#8217;s audiences while taking account of seasonality, and take note of compliance with contract terms of social promotion.</p>\n<p>Are you currently working with athlete or celebrity endorsers for your brand?

              "rendered": "<p>Plenty has been said about Big Data. Today, there’s a line graph for everything.</p>\n<p>But too often, social practitioners end up spinning their wheels in metrics mud. It’s time to cut to the core. While “harnessing Big Data” is great, <em>losing sight of your true KPIs could leave you out of a job.</em></p>\n<p>With that in mind, here are three reports that every company should be utilizing.</p>\n<h3>1. Negative/Positive Engagement Reports</h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_8730\" style=\"width: 560px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\" wp-image-8730 \" title=\"PositiveNegativeEngagement\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/PositiveNegativeEngagement.jpeg\" alt=\"Positive and Negative Engagement Over Time\" width=\"550\" height=\"271\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lucky us, no spike in negative engagement!</p></div>\n<p>When brands begin to engage on social, the first metrics they often want to pull are new fans, likes, and shares.</p>\n<p>While it’s very important to prove that fans are engaging with your content, <strong>it’s also key to track the negative actions</strong>, including <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">unfollow/unlike, hide story, report spam</span>.</p>\n<p>Having a report that compares negative and positive actions over time is a critical piece in measuring your <strong>Net Social Impact</strong>.</p>\n<p>More importantly, you want to know WHO is posting negatively about your brand, but that’s a topic for another day (though sentiment analysis is a very powerful tool every SMMS should be equipped with).</p>\n<h3>2. SLA (Service Level Agreement)</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8724\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\" title=\"SLA Report\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SLA-Report.jpg\" alt=\"service level agreement report\" width=\"550\" height=\"294\" /></p>\n<p>More now than ever before, customers and clients are utilizing social channels to ask questions, file complaints, or otherwise engage with companies whose products or services they have bought or plan to buy. They expect a response in a timely fashion, <em>just as they would if they were calling you.</em></p>\n<p>Sprinklrite Colin Burns recently wrote about one client whose social response equated to <a title=\"The Enterprise Silo “Oh, No!”\" href=\"https://www.sprinklr.com/social-scale-blog/2013/09/12/the-enterprise-silo-oh-no/\">not picking up the phone 99.78% of the time</a>, an all-too-common story among large enterprises who don’t implement an SLA.</p>\n<p>To report on SLA, set a response time goal (say 2 hours) and track operational metrics (for example, <strong>“Time to Response”</strong> and <strong>“Time to </strong><strong>Resolution”</strong>) to see how your company is responding.</p>\n<h3>3. Marketing Campaigns Across Channels</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8726\" title=\"Campaign Scorecard Report\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Campaign-Scorecard-Report.jpg\" alt=\"Campaign Scorecard Report\" width=\"550\" height=\"242\" /></p>\n<p>Knowing the <strong>reach, engagement</strong>, and <strong>number of published posts</strong> for each marketing campaign across all channels (social and otherwise) will help you begin to understand success factors.</p>\n<p>By comparing campaigns, you can determine what content resonates most with your audience. This will help you better understand their preferences. Drill down to view by channel and you’ll be able to determine which types of content perform best in each social channel.</p>\n<p>Along those lines, <strong>make sure you are importing social activity into Google Analytics.</strong></p>\n<p>With the Sprinklr-Google Analytics integration, each shortened URL is automatically appended to include “Campaign” along with “Medium,” “Source,” and any custom criteria, to show the impact social engagement has on your web traffic.</p>\n<p>Now you’re equipped &#8212; go, report on social media! But remember to keep it simple, or risk getting drowned in Big Data.</p>\n<p><strong>Know of a crucial report that you don’t see here?</strong> Let us know in the comments.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sprinklr.com/customer-experience-ebook/\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-103798\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Download-Ebook-CTA-graphic.jpg\" alt=\"Download-Ebook-CTA-graphic\" width=\"735\" height=\"250\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>About the Author:</strong> Lauren McTaggart is Sprinklr&#8217;s Demand Generation Manager.

              "rendered": "<h2>The Evolution of Real-Time Marketing</h2>\n<p>Real-time marketing has continued its ascent in priority for marketers across the digital landscape. As justifiably excited as everyone is by the real-time opportunity, it&#8217;s important to note that brands have been evolving toward more real-time marketing for years. And while  enable a vastly more sophisticated and efficient approach, there is value at each step in the real-time marketing evolutionary ladder.</p>\n<p>At its most basic, the goal of real-time marketing is to position your brand as part of the most relevant conversations among your target audience and reap the brand benefits of that association. To that end, there have been three distinct approaches with real-time marketing examples that have emerged: almanac marketing, event marketing, and true real-time marketing.</p>\n<h3>Almanac Marketing</h3>\n<p>This is the earliest and most common form of real-time style marketing. Brand content creators identify in advance the cultural moments that are likely to be relevant to their target audience, and then plan content accordingly – often weeks in advance. Common examples are the &#8220;Happy National Handwriting Day&#8221; or &#8220;Happy Teacher Appreciation Day&#8221; type posts that emerge from brands regularly. The most effective of these types of posts tend to align to holidays (e.g. Christmas, Fourth of July, Halloween) and hyper-specific celebrations (e.g. National Ice Cream Day for a brand like Haagen Dazs).</p>\n<p>From an operational perspective, almanac marketing is fantastic. Marketers can see an important date coming, develop appropriate creative, time the launch, and then manage any responses through normal social customer service channels. However, from an engagement perspective, almanac marketing leaves a lot to be desired. Mindshare on large and consequential events is scarce, and it takes something quite clever or unique to stand out. This was apparent in the recent attempts by brands to attach to the conversation surrounding the birth of the royal baby. As <a href=\"http://www.adrants.com/2013/07/14-examples-of-royal-baby-realtime.php\">AdRants explains</a>, Oreo, Coca-Cola, Starbucks, and numerous other social media heavyweights attempted to join the conversation with varying degrees of success. Some brands succeeded enormously (as depicted below), but others were lost in the noise of the event.</p>\n<p>A typical Oreo photo tweet generates 50 to 100 retweets and 40 to 75 favorites. Oreo&#8217;s royal baby tweet yielded 1,024 retweets and 415 favorites. That is a more than <strong>900% increase in retweets and 450% increase in favorites.</strong></p>\n<p>For Starbucks, the results are even more impressive. A typical Starbucks UK tweet generates 10 to 40 retweets and 20 to 50 favorites. Starbucks UK&#8217;s royal baby tweet yielded an increase of more than<strong> 3,300% in retweets and 2,000% in favorites.</strong></p>\n<p>In the case of both Oreo and Starbucks, we are looking at massive increases in engagement versus standard, photo-based tweets. Clearly, there is value in joining the right trend in the right way. But many other examples, including Charmin and Hostess, failed to break through. Almanac marketing works and can be an effective stepping stone in a brand&#8217;s evolution toward real-time marketing, but there is only so much room for brands in any given mainstream conversation.</p>\n<h3>Event Marketing</h3>\n<p>Event marketing and sponsorship is nothing new for brands. But in the last few years it has become increasingly commonplace for brands to weave social content and activation into their field and event marketing tactics. A good example is VisitFlorida and iHeartRadio&#8217;s recent Ultimate Pool Party. This mammoth, multi-day party in Miami was accompanied by a host of “preview, real-time, and recap” content from the brands participating.</p>\n<p>This sort of real-time marketing is similar to almanac marketing in that the brand knows well in advance that the event will occur, and even has the ability to pre-program some percentage of its content for the day. However, it varies in two key ways. First, the brand is not moving toward an existing consumer conversation; instead, they are trying to trigger a conversation. Second, the brand usually enters the day with an explicit mission of flexibility and user engagement that is very much in the real-time spirit. There is a framework of content creation, but with a lot of built-in, real-time flexibility.</p>\n<p>A closely related (but far sexier) cousin of event marketing could be called spectacle marketing. You can think of the famous Old Spice Man social media campaign as a standout example of this approach. In the case of Old Spice Man, the activation tactic was a combination of extreme novelty, celebrity interaction, and bizarre humor. The real-time aspect of the campaign – quickly creating a vast array of humorous videos – was the key to the whole spectacle. Extremely high-quality video responses to an array of tweets were created in record time, and that sort of real-time interaction was so unheard of that the engagement spiked to unprecedented levels. The campaign spread like wildfire across both Twitter and YouTube, and effectively relaunched the Old Spice brand as a relevant youth brand instead of an “old man” aftershave.<br />\n<iframe width=\"1100\" height=\"619\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nFDqvKtPgZo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />\nWhen executed correctly, the benefit of this sort of campaign is apparent; Old Spice sales were <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2010/07/27/old-spice-sales/\">up 107% in the month</a> following the viral campaign. However, marketers need to concede a few basic issues before going off to recreate the Old Spice Man campaign. First, despite numerous efforts in the years since the original campaign, no one has succeeded in hijacking the zeitgeist of the internet in that same way. Except maybe Red Bull Stratos…and they dropped a guy out of space. Second, given the costs required to execute an Old Spice Man or Red Bull Stratos quality event, success has to be nearly assured, and unfortunately most efforts of this kind in the year since have failed. Modest success in almanac marketing or event marketing is acceptable because of their relatively modest costs. When an expensive spectacle campaign ends up not being much of a social spectacle, the outcome is not as acceptable. Jobs are lost over things like that.</p>\n<p>So if you&#8217;re a brand that wants the quality engagement and reliability of almanac marketing without the budgetary commitment and uneven nature of event or spectacle marketing, what do you do? The answer is true real-time marketing.</p>\n<h3>True Real-Time marketing</h3>\n<p>True real-time marketing is actually, well, real-time. It is defined as “‘on-the-fly’ participation by brands in the events, topics, and ideas trending at that very moment among target audiences online.&#8221; You can prepare all the operational capabilities beforehand, but until the moment of truth a brand does not know what it is going to make or discuss. True real-time marketing should also be oriented at the specific conversations of target audiences that are most important to a brand. Attempting to participate in general trends is great, but global trends are a crowded and noisy place – as we saw with the royal baby conversation. For every one Oreo tweet from the Super Bowl blackout, there are 100 attempts at real-time marketing that disappear without a sound (or a re-tweet).<br />\nAn excellent example of true real-time marketing is U.S. Cellular&#8217;s social sales program that reacts to live tweets from competitors’ dissatisfied customers, responding with customized messages on a real-time basis – 365 days a year. This is an instance of a highly responsive content team moving toward a lively consumer conversation, and inserting an interesting piece of content into that conversation.</p>\n<p>The opportunity to execute tactics of this type for brands is present every single day. Technology now enables brands to see the specific trends that their target advocates, influencers, and prospects are congregating around at any given moment. Every one of those trends is a viable real-time marketing opportunity for a team that is organized to tackle it rapidly and efficiently. The dashboard below displays trends being discussed among Oreo&#8217;s advocates at 1:00pm Central Time on August, 27, 2013. While not every trend is brand appropriate, there are at least five opportunities there for Oreo to create content and join an active conversation among its most prized audience.</p>\n<p>There are substantial operational challenges that brands face to effectively execute true real-time marketing, but there are ways to make it easier, and technological solutions have emerged (most notably Dachis Group&#8217;s Real-Time Marketing Engine) to speed up the transition.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Any brand can now become a real-time marketer. It will often be easiest to get started with almanac style marketing, but the potential upside of daily, real-time participation in your target audience’s conversations is too great to pass up.</p>\n",

The Council, composed of individuals working on Social Business initiatives in large companies around the world, is a fascinating source of adoption data from the cutting edge of the Social Business landscape. The survey exposed some counter intuitive data surrounding the use of social tools:</p>\n<p><em>If everyone agrees that employees are a critical resource for their business programs, why are they struggling so mightily to activate them? </em></p>\n<h3>Challenge: How do you leverage your employees to amplify company messaging?</h3>\n<p>Employees are becoming an increasingly important source of trusted advocacy for enterprises. Think about it &#8211; employees are trusted experts about your company with decades of experience in your industry. Plus if your company prospers they will also, so it&#8217;s to their benefit to support your brand. The result is that if employees retweet or share content published by their marketing department, they could save their company thousands, or hundreds of thousands of dollars in advertising costs.</p>\n<p>But interestingly, there are  serious inconsistencies in the data surrounding employee advocacy at large organizations. Here is what we found:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The great news is that 41% of the survey respondents agree or strongly agree that their company’s employees are motivated to share content their brand publishes.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>It seems odd then that 53% of the survey respondents disagree or strongly disagree that they could coordinate large employee social participation. And “large” is only defined as “10% or more” of the workforce.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Also 67% of respondents said that if their company hired a new CEO, less than 5% of employees would share the news.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>The bottom line is that employees are <strong>not</strong> amplifying company messaging, despite the fact that social marketers believe they are motivated to do so.</em></p>\n<h3> Keys to Activating Your Employees: Social Media Tools and Content Strategy</h3>\n<p><strong>Create Shareable Content</strong> &#8211; A little exploration will reveal what your employees are likely to share. Do they use their social channels for business or personal reasons? Create content that will bring value to the social ecosystem your employees live in.</p>\n<p><strong>Make It Easy</strong> &#8211; In digital, friction is death. Forget about emailing your employees to remind them to retweet your content. There are social media tools that solve this problem.</p>\n<p>At Dachis Group, we have a portal to log into where we see content we might want to share. We click on what we find interesting and it’s shared instantly via the channels we preselect. It’s also gamified so that people are ranked according to how much earned media they produce for the company.</p>\n<p>If you are not leveraging your workforce to amplify your brand’s social initiatives, you are missing out on an incredible opportunity. Focus on content strategy and finding the right social media tool to facilitate employee activation.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/?page_id=1752\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-105443\" alt=\"CTA-graphic-opt2\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/CTA-graphic-opt2.jpg\" width=\"735\" height=\"85\" /></a></p>\n",

              "rendered": "<p>One of the most significant recently has been the growth of companies creating dedicated <em>centers of excellence</em> (CoE) to drive improved results, consistency, and economies of scale.</p>\n<p>Since tactical social media initiatives are still quite common, organizations are finding that company-related social media activity is taking place across a larger and larger swath of functions in burgeoning social businesses. As this happens, the need is felt to make social media more coherent, less duplicative, more answerable to the business, and better organized and managed.</p>\n<p>Not only is it extremely common to find at least two major social media efforts in most enterprises today (usually a set of social marketing and CRM initiatives that is externally facing and a social collaboration effort that is inwardly focused), but there is often multiple instances in of each, especially in larger and geographically distributed firms and conglomerates.</p>\n<p>Other duplication typically abounds as well, both in the primary social platforms being used and the secondary capabilities like marketing automation, social analytics, security, compliance, and identity, as well as points of integration with regular line of business applications. So too with staff and roles such as social marketing leads, community management, social publishing, and customer care.</p>\n<h2>Investing in Social Media</h2>\n<p>As a result, as senior executives these days have generally moved beyond asking why they should invest in social media (most organizations are <a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/the-leading-indicators-of-social-business-maturity-in-2012-7000008162/\">clearly doing so today</a>), but rather how they can establish better organization, discipline, and cost effectiveness, while still broadly unleashing the social capabilities of their organizations. Some of this is to help answer the long-standing question of who is ultimately in charge of social media? Is it a central function? Or does it make more sense as a decentralized set of loosely coordinated activities on the edge, closer to where work gets done.</p>\n<p>For most companies, instead of creating a new social media department, they are creating centers of excellence that support the rest of the organization, yet actually has dedicated staff and resources that can establish consistent guidelines, unify social tools and platforms where it makes sense, collect techniques and best practices, provide education and bootstrapping, and establish <a href=\"http://www.informationweek.com/social-business/strategy/how-to-scale-social-business-for-the-rea/240007492\">a central monitoring and dispatch capability</a> to respond and engage in social media at scale.</p>\n<h2>Building a Social Media Center of Excellence</h2>\n<h3>1) Social media stakeholders: CoE staff and internal customers</h3>\n<p>The early days of establishing a center of excellence tends to be politically fraught, with concerns about over-centralization and prized social media functions at a local level getting moved to a larger bureaucracy in another area within the company. But the first step is clearly understanding who is engaging in important social media activity within the company today. The pattern tends to be the same: There are one or two major initiatives, 5-10 departmental initiatives, and a lot of smaller informal or shadow activities.</p>\n<p>Going forward, all of these social media activities will receive support from the CoE, which will &#8212; over time &#8212; introduce consistency across tools, policy, and processes. This takes time to establish but as a service bureau and support unit, the CoE has the means and resources to help all of the business units succeed, from ramping up a social media effort, to managing it, and then optimizing it.</p>\n<p>One of the <a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/blog/hinchcliffe/community-management-the-essential-capability-of-successful-enterprise-2-0-efforts/913\">essential social business functions</a>, community management, is frequently centralized under the CoE, though subject matter-specific communty managers typically remain distributed across the organization in their particular line of business. Executives are also key stakeholders of the CoE. They can use its existence to better exert oversight, participate in governance, set goals, and monitor the progress of social media across the organization using reports, dashboards, and other types of data provided by the CoE team.</p>\n<h3>2) Key social processes and activities</h3>\n<p>While a large part of the CoE&#8217;s function is to respond to requests for assistance from across the organization, a lot takes place on a regular basis that was formerly managed locally, informally, and in a fragmented fashion. Proactive activities include centralized listening, dispatch of key events to internal stakeholder, reporting, measurement, community management, education and training, risk management, governance, and the coordination of crises in social media. Plus evaluation of tools, new social media channels, and <a href=\"http://www.informationweek.com/social-business/strategy/how-smart-businesses-reorganize-for-soci/240006107\">enterprise-wide social media strategy development</a> and planning.</p>\n<p>As a result of all of this, I&#8217;m often asked how many full time staff a CoE must have in order to be useful and adequately support the demands that will be put upon it. Typically, most enterprises, even large ones, are reluctant to have more than a handful of FTEs supporting social media across the company, at least at first. Today, we typically see CoE staff sizes based on level of social media maturity. Thus, immature organizations usually have 1-2 FTEs initially. This makes it difficult to have an acceptable service level, even with volunteer efforts from other employees. Organizations that have moved beyond the early stages typically have a CoE leader (often called the social media manager), a social media manager, a content manager, and a couple of community managers. The most mature organizations frequently have 5-10 FTEs in their CoE, including the community management team.</p>\n<h3>3) Portfolio of social tools, platforms, identities, and standards</h3>\n<p>Social media is greatly enabled by the right social technology, maintained in an effective architecture. The specific details vary by industry, organization, and even by the part of the organization. The CoE has the unenviable job of sorting out the confluence of social silos and activities and bringing some semblance of order and consistency. Most CoEs quickly realize there is no one tool or silver bullet when it comes to social technology. All of CoEs manage large and growing portfolio of social tools, platforms, and <a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/how-we-can-create-open-standards-for-social-business-7000017420/\">standards</a>, with a focus on careful introduction of new tools and rationalization of existing ones so that fragmentation, risk, excess effort, and duplication <a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/are-social-media-silos-holding-back-business-results-7000017227/\">are managed to an acceptable level</a>.</p>\n<h3>4) Operating requirements and goals</h3>\n<p>Together, the stakeholders of the CoE &#8212; particularly the internal customers and the executive team (which are typically collectively the ones contributing funding to the new unit) &#8212; set the objectives for the CoE. This includes everything from a vision and charter to an expected level of service and detailed business goals. At a high level, the expectation is that the CoE will help drive higher level of business performance, consistency, efficiency, risk, and ROI tracking. Most CoEs I&#8217;ve seen review operating goals carefully with stakeholders at least once a year, usually right before the yearly budget cycle starts.</p>\n<h3>5) Knowledge base: Lessons learned and best practices</h3>\n<p>One of the most vital outputs of the work of the CoE is a body of knowledge about how best to apply social media in the organization. Most of the processes and activities in the CoE generate valuable information that other stakeholders can learn from.</p>\n<p>CoEs that have the greatest impact actively capture and share this knowledge, often in a social tool/repository, and ensure everyone can access it and learn from it. The social media knowledge base contains best practices, lessons learned, playbooks for common social activities, a trouble ticket system, FAQ, policy framework, and most recently, a content directory which contains the social media assets of the organization.</p>\n<h2>CoEs: A major shift to social media maturity</h2>\n<p>A few years ago, I explored the early days of social media organization and we&#8217;ve seen it come quite a long way in the interim. Companies are readily funding CoEs as social becomes infused with so much of what we do. As digital business becomes an ever more dominant part of our organizations, the CoE is becoming the de facto social media department, with the caveat that is must have full contact with and actively support the rest of the organization for it to hope to scale and add sufficient value to warrant the investment.</p>\n<p>For now, most organizations are still experimenting with how they should best organize for social media, and the CoE seems to be the leading model at the moment. There are certainly others however, and I&#8217;d love to hear your stories on how you company is structuring its social media efforts.</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Reading:<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.informationweek.com/social-business/strategy/how-to-compose-an-effective-social-media/240144205\">How to Compose an Effective Social Media Team</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2011/04/04/program-plan-the-social-media-center-of-excellence/\">Program Plan: The Social Media Center of Excellence</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sprinklr.com/social-paid-whitepaper/\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-104970\" alt=\"Paid-Social-CTA-graphic\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Paid-Social-CTA-graphic.jpg\" width=\"735\" height=\"250\" /></a></p>\n",

So we thought we&#8217;d take a look at what our big data social analytics platform revealed  about the best fashion brands in social media. We ranked 60 global fashion brands across critical social performance indicators like Audience, Earned Media, Engagement, Participation, and Advocacy. Read on to see what we learned:</p>\n<h3>Burberry is the best social media fashion brand</h3>\n<p>Whether sharing exclusive insider info from fashion week or their new fall lineup, Burberry use social media like a true innovator. They were one of the <a href=\"http://fashionista.com/2013/06/burberry-and-michael-kors-among-brands-to-jump-on-new-instagram-video-service/\">first brands to embrace Instagram for Video</a>, are a consistent leader in content creation, and are exemplary when it comes to making their brand feel omnipresent, but still exclusive and luxurious using social media.</p>\n<h3>INNOVATORS: Burberry, Victoria&#8217;s Secret, Louis Vuitton, H&amp;M, and FOREVER 21</h3>\n<p>Burberry isn&#8217;t the only leading fashion brand. Victoria&#8217;s Secret, Louis Vuitton, H&amp;M, and Forever 21 deserve serious commendation for  their social marketing. These brands encourage engagement and advocacy with everything they do.  Forever 21 in particular  and Facebook into a showcase for everything that makes fast fashion so playful, addictive, and shareable. It all makes perfect sense given the significant presence of the brand&#8217;s core audience (digital native teens) on Instagram. What better way to build affinity and remind them to stop in on the weekend to try out the latest product.</p>\n<h3>LEADERS: Vans, Michael Kors, Gucci, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, and Dior</h3>\n<p>Falling just outside the top 5, these brands are without a doubt Leaders in the fashion industry. Whether it&#8217;s the highly engaging event strategy from Vans or incredible digital storytelling from Dior as evidenced by their more than 16 million views on YouTube (the most of any fashion brand), or Dolce &amp; Gabbana&#8217;s embrace of Vine.</p>\n<h3>ACHIEVERS: Old Navy, Polo Ralph Lauren, Roberto Cavalli, Coach, and Gap</h3>\n<p>Coach exemplifies the high achieving nature of these five brands. Coach has shown it really understands global luxury marketing through its approach to the China market. The perfect example is their <a href=\"http://www.jingdaily.com/coach-takes-to-weibo-with-year-of-the-dragon-e-cards/13615/\">Chinese New Year promotion </a>which entailed a simultaneous launch of eCommerce capabilities in China, the creation of a WeChat presence, regional celebrity endorsement, and a sophisticated e-card campaign that triggered serious social sharing.</p>\n<h2>The Top 15 Best Fashion Brands in Social Media</h2>\n<p>Want to learn more about the fashion rankings?

In short, after years of declining results in old channels, companies have finally <a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/social-media-will-ultimately-permeate-the-enterprise-7000010636/\">come to terms</a> with the fact they must fundamentally rethink how they connect with the marketplace.</p>\n<p>In the last couple of years, companies have increasingly sought out so-called &#8216;genuine&#8217; and &#8216;authentic&#8217; new ways of reaching out to, conversing with, and otherwise collaborating together in useful ways with those on social media on topics of mutual interest, namely the products and services that they provide. This has led to countless experiments in adapting social media to the marketing function in our organizations, while also living up to both the standards (and expectations) of the new social channels.<br />\n<!--more (read me...)--><br />\n<a href=\"/?page_id=1752\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-105443\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/CTA-graphic-opt2.jpg\" alt=\"CTA-graphic-opt2\" width=\"735\" height=\"85\" /></a></p>\n<p>The question has always been, however, how to best use social media with the least cynicism and the greatest effect to truly engage with the marketplace, while having measurable and cost effective business impact. While the short term goal of such activity might be driving new transactions (sales and other outcomes), the long term goal is to partner with and co-create the best joint outcomes. This includes producing better products, ensuring they are supported well, and more prosaic yet very valuable results such as increasing margins and reducing time to sale.</p>\n<p>Over the last several years, we&#8217;ve started to see a new trend clearly emerge from leading social businesses: Companies dealing with the realization that they have limited &#8212; and relatively untrusted &#8212; amounts of social capital in their possession. Certainly, a few companies are doing extremely well in this regard, but the total level of reach in social media of even most large brands is relatively limited.</p>\n<p>Yet those very same companies also have legions of interested parties who do have &#8212; at least collectively &#8212; a tremendous amount of social capital that they just might be willing to employ for mutual benefit. If only they had guidance on how best to do it.</p>\n<p>In short, savvy companies can <a href=\"https://www.sprinklr.com/social-scale-blog/10-steps-successful-employee-advocacy/\">strategically enlist their workforce</a>, business partners, supply chain, customers, and other interested stakeholders to become advocates, if the right motivation exists. Now, while I observed recently that the environment for advocacy in social media has grown increasingly favorable, and the infrastructure, techniques, and management processes have moved beyond early experimentaton, we really haven&#8217;t talked about specific examples of successful social media advocacy programs. In other words, is there actually good evidence that advocacy works and is happening?</p>\n<p>Fortunately, the lack of good examples of social advocacy programs is no longer the issue. In fact, we find they are starting to thrive in many industries, even while the exact result and approach remain relatively varied, usually a sign of early days. For now, the advocacy programs that exist currently are largely focused on the constituency that companies have the most direct influence over, namely employees, though certainly we know of good examples across the constituency spectrum.</p>\n<p>In terms of trust and predictability, <a href=\"https://www.sprinklr.com/social-scale-blog/5-essential-tips-for-promoting-employee-brand-advocacy-on-linkedin/\">employees make a good &#8216;starter&#8217; group</a> for companies to get up to speed on creating an advocate program. Employees obviously have a vested interest in furthering the goals of the company, and their alignment with the organization&#8217;s interests and objectives is presumably (though certainly not always) why they are employed there.</p>\n<link rel='stylesheet' href='https://blog.sprinklr.com/wp-content/plugins/spirnklr-fusion-shortcodes/shortcodes/spr-custom-cta.php/../../assets//css/spr-custom-cta.css' type='text/css' media='all'><script src='https://blog.sprinklr.com/wp-content/plugins/spirnklr-fusion-shortcodes/shortcodes/spr-custom-cta.php/../../assets/js/spr-custom-cta.js'></script>\n      <div class='spr-custom-cta'>\n        <div class='bkg-ltgrey'>\n          <div class='spr-custom-cta-row'>\n            <div class='spr-custom-cta-image-container' style='background-image: url(https://blog.sprinklr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/20180515_influencer4_feature.jpg);'></div>\n            <div class='spr-custom-cta-text-container'>\n              <h3 class='spr-custom-cta-title'>Looking for advocates outside your organization?</h3>\n              <div class='spr-custom-cta-text'>Find influencers for your brand</div>\n              <a href=''><button class='btn btn-lg btn-spr-yellow spr-custom-cta-button btn-spr-dark-blue'>Start here</button></a>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    \n<h3>Eight examples of employee advocacy programs</h3>\n<p>Here are a breakdown of some of the advocacy programs &#8212; many current, and some past &#8212; that leading enterprises have engaged in:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>IBM.</strong> The global technology firm has 500 thought leaders in its <a href=\"https://www-304.ibm.com/social/aggregator/ibm\">IBM Voices</a> advocacy program, including a matching portal to centralize and promote their social presence.</li>\n<li><strong>Cisco.</strong> The communications company has over 1,300 advocates that <a href=\"http://socialmediatoday.com/dadovanpeteghem/287522/how-cisco-successfully-integrates-social-media-their-organisation\">are given guidelines and support</a> to amplify the company&#8217;s messages and get the word out about new products and services as well as provide support to customers.</li>\n<li><strong>Dell.</strong> The computer manufacturer has one of the largest social media advocacy programs in the world. <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jenniferrooney/2012/09/25/in-dell-social-media-journey-lessons-for-marketers-about-the-power-of-listening/\">Over 10,000 employees</a> having gone through their internal social media certification program and are trained to support the company&#8217;s objectives in social media. What&#8217;s more, they have an advanced listening and triage program to mobilize advocates to address time critical situations in social channels.</li>\n<li><strong>Deloitte.</strong> The global management services firm employed a social advocate program with over 1,200 members to help with recruiting.</li>\n<li><strong>SAP.</strong> Long a leader in using social media to engage with the marketplace, SAP&#8217;s has its <a href=\"http://scn.sap.com/community/sap-mentors\">SAP Mentor program</a> that recognizes its most effective advocates, gives them prestige and makes it easier for the public to find and engage with them.</li>\n<li><strong>Sprint.</strong> The company&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/kenmakovsky/2012/09/20/employee-engagement-at-its-most-social/\">Sprint Ninjas employee advocacy program</a> continues to grow, with about 2,000 employees now and a target of about 8,000 eventually.</li>\n<li><strong>H&amp;R Block.</strong> The tax preparation firm uses an internal social media hub <a href=\"http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/how-hr-block-uses-social-media-to-enhance-customer-relations/\">as part of its program</a> to connect employees with the public in social media. It has also used advocates effectively in recent marketing and sales efforts.</li>\n<li><strong>Fidelity.</strong> The financial services firm <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/annemariekelly/2012/02/07/fidelity-cmo-jim-speros-on-turn-here-and-consumer-engagement-in-a-multi-screen-world/\">has an ongoing &#8216;Turn Here&#8217; program</a>, which has a component that connects employees in scale with their consumer engagement effort.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note, that these examples are tech heavy, as we often see with social media. Fortunately, we are now seeing more traditional companies try their hand at advocacy programs now. Also, there is a good mix of B2B and B2C stories when it comes to employee advocacy which is encouraging.</p>\n<p>Up next, I will explore good examples of social media advocacy programs with business partners, customers, and even supply chains.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sprinklr.com/customer-advocacy-whitepaper/\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-107332\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Customer-advocacy-CTA.png\" alt=\"Customer advocacy CTA\" width=\"753\" height=\"268\" /></a></p>\n",

              "rendered": "<p>Real-time marketing as a concept and capability has quickly become a priority for marketers everywhere. Unfortunately, we must also acknowledge that despite the hype, real-time marketing is too complex and costly for most brands to actually execute against. Take the example of Johnson &amp; Johnson&#8217;s Diabetes Group<a href=\"http://www.digiday.com/brands/the-real-time-marketing-myth/\"> featured in Digiday</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“We are FDA-regulated and must be healthcare compliant,” Panchak said. “We have to go through a lot of steps to get a piece of content posted.”</p>\n<p>For J&amp;J, that means tons of preparation. The first thing the social team at J&amp;J does is put together a content calendar, and then it comes up with a legal-approved list of statements and comments to use as responses that will come out of the post. It does take some guessing, but knowing your audience is key here, because there’s no other way to anticipate how people are going to react to something. J&amp;J has put together what it calls the “social action team,” with one person handling each platform. Also part of the team is someone from J&amp;J’s legal personnel and an agency counterpart. &#8211; <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pub/thomas-panchak/1/107/340\">Thomas Panchak, Senior Director of Integrated Marketing, Diabetes Group at Johnson &amp; Johnson</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>The definition of real-time marketing is “on-the-fly” participation by brands in the events, topics, and ideas trending at that very moment among target audiences online. The trend is most famously exemplified by successful marketing tactics like <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/02/04/oreo_super_bowl_blackout_tweet_dazzles_twitter_reveals_low_bar_for_brands.html\">Oreo&#8217;s tweet from the SuperBowl blackout</a> and disastrous ones like <a href=\"http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/9286/Learning-From-Kenneth-Cole-s-Social-Media-Mistake.aspx\">Kenneth Cole&#8217;s tweet about protests in Egypt</a> or <a href=\"http://socialmediatoday.com/steve-olenski/1397091/epicurious-uses-boston-marathon-tragedy-cross-line\">Epicurious&#8217; tweets following the Boston marathon bombing</a>.</p>\n<p>The appeal is obvious: participating in a mass cultural event and earning huge amounts of earned media for very little visible cost is incredibly tantalizing to any marketer. The problem however is that almost every real-time marketing example today is an example of flawed and unsustainable business practice.</p>\n<p>The hallmarks of successful real-time marketing are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem\">Timely publication</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem\">High quality content (usually multimedia)</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem\">Enthusiastic response from the brand&#8217;s target audience </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In order to achieve this, brands have embraced one of two models for their real-time marketing &#8211; the war room and the lone contributor. Neither of which is particularly good.</p>\n<h3>The Marketing Plan:</h3>\n<p>Entrust a multi-talented community manager with responsibility to find and join social trends that matter, create content that is appropriate, publish that content, and interact with ensuing commentary.</p>\n<h3>The Business Problem:</h3>\n<p>While this solution is fast, it doesn&#8217;t have the controls most brands need and puts far too much pressure on a single individual:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem\">Community managers aren&#8217;t stand up comedians</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem\">Community managers aren&#8217;t copywriters</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem\">Community managers aren&#8217;t creative directors</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem\">Community managers aren&#8217;t regulatory experts</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem\">Community managers lack seniority (most are relatively junior marketers)</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem\">Community managers go to sleep sometimes</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Plus, even if your community manager is a funny copywriter with killer graphic design experience, 10 years seniority, and a Red Bull addiction &#8211; how will they know which trends are the right ones to participate in outside of obvious big-time events like the Super Bowl?</p>\n<h3>The Marketing Plan:</strong></p>\n<h3>\n<p>Assemble a SWAT team of internal brand leaders and external agency partners. Get them in a room for the upcoming Super Bowl / Royal Wedding / Oscars. Equip them with lots of televisions, snacks, and Apple products.</p>\n<h3>The Business Problem:</h3>\n<p>War rooms are pretty clearly the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironclad_warship#First_battles_between_ironclads:_the_U.S._Civil_War\" rel=\"nofollow\">Civil War ironclad ships</a> of our era. Namely, they are a just good enough solution only useful for a specific moment in time:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem\">There are only a few truly significant events per year that fit &#8216;big deal &#8216;criteria, thus limiting real-time marketing opportunities.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem\">It is extremely expensive and inconvenient to pull an entire team into a room to watch T.V. and write tweets together.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem\">Every brand will be competing for the exact same share of voice during the exact same event &#8211; are you really the most clever?</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem\">Your specific audience may not even care about the event.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How to fix real-time marketing</h2>\n<p>Marketers need a new set of tools that make real-time marketing affordable, measurable and efficient. They need ongoing brand-specific trend identification, virtual workflow, and comprehensive analytics.</p>\n<h3>Brand trend identification</h3>\n<p>There are countless social trends every month that a brand could participate in. Marketers need some way to know what trends matter to their audiences. The trends that matter to Nike are different than the trends that matter to Kraft. And brands that know which trends matter today to their audiences can enter into hyper-specific conversations where they KNOW their target audiences will respond.</p>\n<p>We built trend identification capability into our analytics platform to automatically surface topics and news that matter most to a brand&#8217;s specific audience. You can see how long the topic has been trending, how important is it to your audience, and whether other brands have already started participating &#8211; because no one wants to be the 14th (or 50th!) brand to make a harlem shake video.</p>\n<h3>Virtual marketing workflow</h3>\n<p>Once a trend is identified marketers need a better solution than to pull the team together in a conference room. It doesn&#8217;t make sense to have a copywriter, a graphic designer, and senior decision makers in a room so you can tweet quickly once or twice a year.</p>\n<p>There is collaborative workflow built directly into our real-time platform. Use it to easily highlight trends and then route them across your organization and agency for production, review, and approval.</p>\n<h3>Comprehensive social analytics</h3>\n<p>Real-time marketing posts will always just be part of the responsibilities of social marketers. They must also maintain their day-to-day responsibilities of community management, daily content production and campaign support. Consequently, real-time marketing activities that occur in a vacuum are problematic &#8211; they break the measurement framework that a brand has put in place.</p>\n<p>The Dachis Group real-time marketing solution is embedded directly into our social analytics platform. The result is unified social analytics across campaigns, day-to-day content and real-time marketing. All using our existing comprehensive set of 50+ metrics and powerful collaborative reporting capabilities.</p>\n<p>Real-time marketing is here to stay, but it&#8217;s time that brands embrace this powerful trend correctly.<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.sprinklr.com/social-media-compliance-whitepaper/\"><img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Enterprise-Social-Compliance-CTA-graphic.png\" alt=\"Enterprise-Social-Compliance-CTA-graphic\" width=\"735\" height=\"250\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-105168\" /></a></p>\n",

Let&#8217;s start by simply clarifying where the technology and potential is bringing us.</p>\n<h2>Real-Time Marketing Definition</h2>\n<p>Real-time marketing is &#8220;on-the-fly&#8221; participation by brands in the events, topics, and ideas trending at that very moment among target audiences online. You&#8217;ve heard of the <em>Just In Time</em> production process which enables manufacturing to have what is needed, exactly when it&#8217;s needed; that dynamic is possible because of the real-time interaction between the demands of production and the source of resources &#8211; the same concept applies here: enabling a large organization to deliver the exact right piece of content swiftly and efficiently to a mass social audience.</p>\n<p><a style=\"line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem\" href=\"http://blog.drskippy.com/\">Scott Hendrickson</a><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem\">, Chief Data Scientist at </span><a style=\"line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem\" href=\"http://gnip.com/\">GNIP</a><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem\">, captured, during Austin&#8217;s </span><span style=\"line-height: 1.71429;font-size: 1rem\">Social Business Summit</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.714285714;font-size: 1rem\"> this year, that signal takes off from zero and peaks 5 to 20 minutes later. That&#8217;s an incredibly tiny window in which a brand must act to be a relevant, authentic part of a mass conversation.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Gone are the days when you could plan out your marketing and public relations programs well in advance and release them on your timetable,&#8221; it&#8217;s said on behalf of <a href=\"http://www.davidmeermanscott.com/\">David Meerman Scott&#8217;s</a> book <em>Real-Time Marketing and PR</em>. &#8220;&#8216;Real time&#8217; means news breaks over minutes, not days. It means companies develop (or refine) products or services instantly, based on feedback from customers or events in the marketplace. And it&#8217;s when businesses see an opportunity and are the first to act on it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Embracing the potential of real-time marketing can have an incredible impact on your business. In a February 2012 <a href=\"http://www.golinharris.com/\">GolinHarris</a> survey, consumers expressed greater positive feelings about brands after they were exposed to real-time marketing than before e<em>xposure. Nearly half said they would feel more positive, while 46% would be more interested in the brand.</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.julioviskovich.com/\">Julio Viskovic</a>, <em>Sales Sensei</em> at <a href=\"http://hootsuite.com\">HootSuite</a>, shared with <a href=\"http://blog.marketo.com/blog/2013/05/the-benefits-of-embracing-real-time-marketing-on-social-channels-and-beyond.html\">Marketo</a> in a great post for the marketing automation tool, &#8220;Real-time marketing is a process that enables marketers to capitalize on real-time events and deliver a relevant message to the right person at the right time. Ideas must be developed in minutes rather than days or weeks. And messaging centers around real-time feedback from customers or around current events that happen. The benefit of this type of marketing, is that you can capitalize on trending topics that your followers can relate to.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Are we there yet? Certainly, Gartner&#8217;s predictions of the <a href=\"http://www.itworldcanada.com/news/gartners-top-10-tech-trends-for-2012/144169\">Top 10 Technologies of <strong>2011</strong></a> suggested that whatever the nomenclature, real-time marketing is here and will continue to evolve. And two years later, it has.</p>\n",

H&amp;M has always been a leader in fast-fashion straight off the runway, but what makes the brand robust and engaging on social media is its winning combination of star power and consumer-aligned values.</p>\n<p>For the past three weeks, major spikes in brand passion revolved around three key events:</p>\n<p>1) 4/25: The debut of a Beyoncé Ad on Youtube</p>\n<p>2) 5/2: The release of the new Water Collection in stores and online</p>\n<p>3) 5/13: The signing of the Bangladesh Safety Agreement</p>\n<p><strong>Celebrity Endorsement Drives Social Media Engagement</strong></p>\n<p>The global retail clothing company has collaborated with some of the biggest names in fashion and popular culture, including Versace, Jimmy Choo, Lana Del Rey, David Beckham, and now, Beyoncé.</p>\n<p>A YouTube <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMok-RBgj1I\">music video ad</a> posted on April 25th featured Beyoncé singing her tropical new song, “Standing on the Sun,” and strutting in swimwear from H&amp;M’s Water Collection. The day after the video was up, there was a jump in discussion strength on Twitter and Facebook and within 2 weeks, the video received over 1.8 million views and 5,000 likes.</p>\n<p>Then, on May 3rd, the day after the collection was available online and in stores, we see the highest combined spike in discussion strength on both of H&amp;M’s social accounts. Almost all the top Twitter conversation topics, in terms of number of participants and social signal volume, were related to the “Beyoncé as Mrs. Carter in H&amp;M” campaign.</p>\n<p><strong>Consumer-Aligned Values Generate Greater Social Ecosystem Signals</strong></p>\n<p>Corporate social responsibility today is as obligatory as having a Facebook page. It’s important to be both active and reactive when it comes to being socially responsible. H&amp;M is actively responsible by donating 25% of Beyoncé’s Water Collection proceeds to <a href=\"http://wateraid.org\">WaterAid</a> and offering discounts to every customer who donates old clothes. At the same time, the company is reactive, as exemplified by its decision to sign an agreement for more rigorous factory safety inspections and repairs after the Bangladesh garment factory collapse on April 24th that killed over 1,000 workers. H&amp;M’s announcement garnered the most social signals on the Monday it signed the agreement &#8211; fans were more responsive to H&amp;M when they respected the brand.</p>\n<p><strong>What H&amp;M Means to Me as a Consumer</strong></p>\n<p>I think as a clothing company, it is especially important to align yourself with your consumers because people express themselves through their sense of style. H&amp;M’s fan base largely consists of young, trendy teenagers and professionals. As a senior at NYU and an intern at Dachis Group, I’m drawn to stores where I know the shopping experience will be easy and fruitful. H&amp;M is my go-to for affordable, staple pieces that I can layer to go from smart casual to street flirty (but if you want a leopard print bodycon dress, they’ll have that too). A lot of the appeal also stems from the fact that you can get a $15 blazer that won’t <em>look</em> like a $15 blazer. And because H&amp;M isn’t very expensive to begin with, you can keep up with the latest fads without breaking your wallet. They’ve mastered this concept of accessible fashion not only with bang-for-your-buck apparel, but also from an aspirational brand image backed by top-notch stars. I’ve already replayed the YouTube video 10 times (not just for the sake of this post) because it’s catchy, the outfits look great, and you can’t go wrong with Beyoncé. On top of that, H&amp;M’s charitable efforts and just response to the Bangladesh accident make me proud to support them now and in the future.</p>\n<p><strong>What Other Retail Companies Can Learn From H&amp;M</strong></p>\n<p>Other retail clothing companies can learn from the way H&amp;M stays in tune with its customers. Consumers see brands as extensions of themselves so brands need to be hip but humble, cool but cognizant. Staying relevant and listening to its followers through celebrity sponsorship and social responsibility has kept the brand in its audience’s consideration set and has translated to H&amp;M’s success as one of the most engaging fashion brands in social media.</p>\n",

              "rendered": "<p>Like thousands of other women last week, I was deeply impacted by a video from Dove&#8217;s Real Beauty campaign &#8212; Dove’s Real Beauty Sketches.</p>\n<p>From behind a curtain, women describe themselves to a forensic artist who creates individual sketches based on their self-descriptions. “I’d say I have a pretty big forehead,” said the woman pictured below. The artist then creates a second sketch of the same women, this time based on descriptions from other people (strangers who were asked to spend time with each other earlier in the day). “She had very nice blue eyes,” a gentleman commented of the same woman. As you might imagine, the resulting sketches are dramatically different.</p>\n<p>When I watched the video, I had tears in my eyes and took a moment to pause and reflect (not something that a brand makes me do very often during a busy workday). And I immediately shared the video with all of the special women in my life. Maybe it’s simply because I am a woman. Maybe it’s because I just looked through 644 photos from my February wedding and analyzed and critiqued almost every one that I was in. Maybe the side-by-side sketches in this video reflect countless conversations with female friends about my perception of their incredible beauty vs. their own.</p>\n<p>I think it’s all of the above. The Dove brand is brave enough to look under the hood and expose the real emotions and insecurities that motivate its customers. How refreshing. It clearly resonated with me, and I know that it impacted so many co-workers and friends that I spoke with. So, I wondered how the rest of the market reacted and what the impact on Dove was looking like across the social landscape.</p>\n<h2>The Impact of Social Media</h2>\n<p>As you might imagine, all of the usual suspects have been on the rise – overall impressions, number of discussions and discussion strength and total social signals. At Dachis Group, we equate these specific measures to impacting a brand’s awareness, of which there’s certainly been a tremendous lift following the release of the Real Beauty Sketches. Loads of people are talking about the video and spreading the word among friends, which had major impact. Check out the campaign’s earned impressions vs. owned (difficult to even see the traction from owned in this chart).</p>\n<p>Beyond awareness, I wanted to dig deeper to understand the brand impact of the makeup of people’s real reactions and the conversation and sharing it inspired, perhaps similar to mine.</p>\n<p>Looking at the overall social activity around the Dove brand over the past week, our measure for <strong>brand passion is up over 1000 percent</strong>. A high passion score indicates not only a large number of conversation participants but also a high frequency of participation that is strongly positive. I think that the passion metric is particularly relevant for this effort – the team at Dove should be energized by this increase!</p>\n<p>What’s more, this passion is especially high among the brand’s advocates that we track. The campaign prompted this group to take action this week at an <strong>increased rate of 350 percent</strong>. Here you can see Dove’s participation in green increase at the time the video launched and then advocate participation in blue rising at the same time and really taking off.</p>\n<p>The power of advocacy at work is really exciting to see. It is having tremendous impact across Dove’s social ecosystem. Let’s peek at some of the specific advocate activity.</p>\n<p>Pretty amazing stuff. And this is just a glimpse into the impact we are tracking across the Web. Our hats are off to Dove.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sprinklr.com/customer-experience-ebook/\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-103798\" alt=\"Download-Ebook-CTA-graphic\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Download-Ebook-CTA-graphic.jpg\" width=\"735\" height=\"250\" /></a></p>\n",

Corporation, works hard to associate itself with youth culture through event sponsorship and music partnerships. It seems to be working. The brand was recently propelled up the Social Business Index by implicit and explicit endorsements of musicians old and new.</p>\n<h3>Metallica and Vans co-present &#8216;The Damage, Inc Stage&#8217; at Orion Music &amp; More Festival</h3>\n<p>The Orion Music &amp; More music festival partnered with Vans to bring Metallica and a massive skate ramp to the Detroit area. Social conversation was propelled by a tweet from Metallica to generate hundreds of social conversations (and the resulting earned media impressions) from Metallica fans and high-flying skate trick fans.</p>\n<h3>Violinists and Punk Rockers Endorse the Product</h3>\n<p>The holy grail for a lifestyle brand is an implicit product endorsement from celebrities with natural credibility among their social audience. Vans saw its social activity increase as a direct consequence of this kind of attention on two occasions last week.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.lindseystirling.com/\">Lindsey Stirling</a> a violin and dance performance artist (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vp63nbOfxgs\">well known for her YouTube clips</a>) shared her new Vans purchase with her avid social audience resulting in compliments galore for Lindsey, and a surge in attention for Vans as well.</p>\n<p>Similarly, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TayJardine\">Taylor Jardine</a>, member of band &#8220;We Are In The Crowd&#8221; showed off her new kicks in a photo on Instagram as well as a tweet. Hundreds of fans liked her photo and complimented her new custom shoes. Vans smartly thanked her for the compliment while basking in the freshly earned attention.</p>\n<p>The resulting activity for Vans was an uptick in Conversation Strength for the brand (a major contributor to Brand Awareness) and hopefully a nice uptick in sales to match.</p>\n<p>This report was produced easily and almost instantly using Dachis Group&#8217;s Social Performance Monitor product.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sprinklr.com/customer-advocacy-whitepaper/\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-107332\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Customer-advocacy-CTA.png\" alt=\"Customer advocacy CTA\" width=\"753\" height=\"268\" /></a></p>\n",

              "rendered": "<p>Who do we ultimately turn to when we need to make important decisions in our lives? That&#8217;s the fundamental question at the heart of so much today when it comes to media, influence, and ultimately, marketing. What&#8217;s more, the reliable sources of trust today are currently on the move. We are in an era where a significant shift in trust is creating an urgent need to change how we engage with each other, our customers, and the marketplace.</p>\n<p>While you&#8217;re undoubtedly aware of the trends in the large, you might not have the very latest data. First, trust in virtually all sources of authority is in marked decline, except for media. Second, according to sources such as <a href=\"http://trust.edelman.com/trust-download/global-results/\">Edelman&#8217;s Trust Barometer for 2012</a>, while business leaders and government officials are experiencing a particularly sharp fall in trust, consumers and regular employees have experienced some of the most significant increases in public regard when it comes to influence and integrity (<em>see chart right.</em>) In other words, regular people are now more trusted than just about any other source.</p>\n<p>Except businesses aren&#8217;t as ready as they could be for this change. Given that this is a very recent development, actionable reservoirs of these vital new sources of trust are something that most companies have in short supply at the moment. The vast industry of media and entertainment, which is now expected to be a <a href=\"http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/global-entertainment-media-outlook/data-insights.jhtml\">$2.1 trillion global industry by 2016</a> will not only be two-thirds digital by then, but set in a new world where the arbiters of authority and influence are not who they were, even as recently as last year.</p>\n<p>As companies <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/markfidelman/2012/11/26/rethinking-the-customer-journey-in-a-social-world/\">redesign their customer journey</a> to be more coherent and consistent so they can provide an orderly and understandable experience in a more sustained fashion during the entire customer lifecycle, they&#8217;re discovering that the decisions people use to stay in that journey increasingly come from these new sources of trusted advocates.</p>\n<h3>Trust and Advocacy Have Moved and Companies Must Adapt</h3>\n<p>The data from eMarketer&#8217;s 2012 brand advocacy report couldn&#8217;t be clearer: Most people now advocate the products and services they enjoy online, and those that do tend to do it a lot, with the vast majority having recommended 5 or more products per year. In short, not only are consumers and line workers much more trusted than they were even a couple of years ago, they&#8217;re also far and away the largest pool of advocacy that exists today.</p>\n<p>So this then is the rub: Companies literally pour hundreds of billions a year worldwide into creating brand awareness, mindshare, and passion for their products. But increasingly, they can only do the first one using traditional paid media.</p>\n<p>Instead, the part of media that matters most, the ability to shape opinion, create engagement, and foster useful outcomes, has moved to new forms of communication. In particular, the rise of social media, in all its modes &#8212; from free form conversations in social networks to highly structured online ratings and reviews &#8212; has coincided with &#8212; and in all probability directly led to &#8212; these major shifts in trust and advocacy.</p>\n<p>But what does all this mean? Will traditional marketing finally fade away and be replaced by social media marketing? Will professional brand marketing disappear entirely as the world depends on largely amateur brand advocates? Not hardly. But both global digital media and the services built upon it <em>are</em> in the process of undergoing a major change. <a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/blog/hinchcliffe/what-will-power-next-generation-businesses/1076\">Peer production</a>, social engagement, <a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/blog/hinchcliffe/made-on-the-web-designed-by-us/1394\">crowdsourcing</a>, and all forms of innovation at the edge has been fundamentally transforming media for over a decade now and its new form is taking shape.</p>\n<p>So it&#8217;s not all one form or the other. It turns out that traditional media is still uniquely powerful for certain activities, such as creating, gathering, and focusing the very communities needed to make new media work in scale. Push media creates the funnel; social media &#8212; now the primary source of trust and motive force &#8212; creates and greatly amplifies the value.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 1.17em;line-height: 1.5em\">Understanding and Activating Advocacy At The Edge</span></h3>\n<p>What resources then do organizations have to put to bear to tap into advocacy and turn their traditional media into community powered vehicles for value creation? (And yes, by value creation, I mean buying, selling, co-creation, and all the other ways that actual business results from all of this advocacy-based communication.) Well, it turns out there are three primary types of advocacy that organizations have at their disposal and that they need to engage with competently:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Paid Advocacy.</strong> These are the advocates that companies ostensibly pay for, such as celebrity endorsers, sponsored athletes, and other influencers that are signed on to the company&#8217;s point-of-view (and accept remuneration.) Paid advocates are particularly effective at aspirational amplification and starting the customer engagement process.</li>\n<li><strong>Owned Advocacy.</strong> While today these are largely the employees of the company that are involved in advocate programs, it also includes business partners and suppliers, which also have a stake &#8212; and a powerful insider&#8217;s advocate perspective &#8212; in the success of your marketing and engagement efforts. Owned advocacy is particularly important in the middle of the funnel, as customers try to ascertain particulars as they get ready to fully engage.</li>\n<li><strong>Earned Advocacy.</strong> The most valuable &#8212; and scalable &#8212; source of advocacy is from actual customers, which are now more trusted than most other sources, although influencers and industry advocates can be important advocates too. The process of earning advocates themselves is the result of the hard work of providing great products and services that are well supported, along with a brand narrative that tells a compelling story. When all this happens, the very best source of marketing becomes the authentic and voluntary expression of countless pleased and engaged customers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Significantly, each of these types of advocacy can be optimized and amplified far better than most organizations are presently doing. This then is the unfortunate insight: While all three types of advocates are largely untapped by most companies, they are now the single most important and significant sources of trusted advocacy that can be mobilized and amplified today to achieve strategic marketing outcomes. Fortunately, all that&#8217;s needed is some way to realize their potential.</p>\n<h3>Making Advocacy Operational</h3>\n<p>The process of successfully locating, activating, and retaining brand advocates could, up until recently, be regarded as a poorly understood art form. Fortunately, the recent rise of big data techniques has increasingly made it a repeatable science in the last 18 months or so. Fortunately, the general workflow in this new world where both trust and scalable advocacy lie largely on the edge of the network, while a very different and less predictable one, is now largely understood. It looks something like this:</p>\n<p><em>Cultivate Your Advocates</em> &#8211; Create a program that will foster and manage your different pools of advocates over time. Employees are a good place to start and get rapid acceleration, but all three groups are vital long term.</p>\n<p><em>Evaluate Your Brand Activities and Impact</em> &#8211; Examine your brand portfolio, brand platforms, associated marketing campaigns, and look at what is working and resonating with the market. These days, this is often aided with powerful analytic dashboards, business intelligence, and reporting tools.</p>\n<p><em>Use Advocacy To Amplify What Works</em> &#8211; Co-create vehicles that take the success stories of your brand and make the most of them. There are now many, many good examples of this to learn from.</p>\n<p><em>Measure and Isolate the Results. Tweak and Repeat.</em> &#8211; Possibly the biggest challenge in doing all this is in making sure it&#8217;s data-driven and grounded in truth. Analyze your advocates activities, separate the signal from the noise (the activities most effective in driving outcomes), and revise what you&#8217;re doing to optimize the results in a natural and continuous process.</p>\n<p>The good news is that the steps above are not a theoretical workflow. The rise of social media command centers over the last couple of years has made this a common and real-time process for many global brands such as Nestle, Gatorade, Red Bull, Coca-Cola, and many others. Today, companies must build their social capital, gathering their advocates around them, and relentlessly engage while using practical methods to uncover and then zero-in on what works. For without embracing the new currency of marketing, companies will continue to have to spend through the decline curves of legacy marketing channels.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sprinklr.com/customer-advocacy-whitepaper/\"><img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Customer-advocacy-CTA.png\" alt=\"Customer advocacy CTA\" width=\"753\" height=\"268\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-107332\" /></a></p>\n",

              "rendered": "<p>There&#8217;s a relatively new thing you can now say for sure about social media. Despite the sheer volume and variety of online conversation today, it <em>can</em> now be readily measured and analyzed in scale. With the advent of <a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/blog/hinchcliffe/how-social-media-and-big-data-will-unleash-what-we-know/1533\">powerful new methods and tools</a> for dissecting and making sense of the millions of conversations taking place globally every day, measurement has become the fundamental skill for cultivating impact with our business activities in social media (aka social business.)</p>\n<p>The nascent social analytics industry has given us potent toolkits that didn&#8217;t exist in usable form more than about two years ago. Leading the vanguard, marketers in particular have jumped into this space as they seek to figure out exactly what effect their efforts have as they employ social media to amplify their traditional marketing, as well as move into pure play social marketing. Never mind that there are still too many tools vendors striving for market leadership, it&#8217;s clearly a fast growing industry. Leaders are still emerging and some will inevitably fall by the wayside.</p>\n<p>For now, however, we currently advise customers to experiment extensively with social analytics, hedge their bets, stay agile, and keep a stable of tools that provide results without building too much on them (yet) as a firm foundation. In general, <a href=\"http://www.informationweek.com/thebrainyard/news/strategy/choose-your-social-business-strategy-bef/240002774\">strategy is more important than tools</a>.</p>\n<h3>Going Beyond Tools To Impactful Measures</h3>\n<p>So, at this point, the availability of tools is generally not the issue when it comes to determining the impact that your social media marketing efforts are having. Instead, the problem is how to best apply them. As the <a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/how-social-data-is-changing-the-way-we-do-business-7000007050/\">proliferation of social data</a> increases globally, we can now perceive and isolate &#8212; almost instantly &#8212; what our customers are saying about us, and make smarter marketing, sales, and support decisions. We can also intervene and get involved in those conversations and push them towards useful business outcomes, including brand awareness and management, as well as that all-important result, increasing sales.</p>\n<p>It turns out, we can get to results most quickly <em>by focusing on the right enabling measures</em>.</p>\n<p>The rise of big data technology now makes it easy to get quantitative and qualitative data about the social universe. But understanding how to use this information in a meaningful way in your social media marketing efforts is the challenge. This is where defining a framework for your measurement efforts can help. As we&#8217;ve seen, organizations must tap into the flow of conversation, as well as get involved in it, and measurement can help every step of the way, from identifying the most important conversations, to determine how effective a company&#8217;s social messages and activities are.</p>\n<p>Certainly, a social team should derive its own set of measures that are relevant to their specific industry, products, and marketing efforts. However, there <em>is</em> a broad set of approaches that they should apply to their efforts, regardless of details. In our experience with social teams in some of the world&#8217;s largest brands, we see four major measurement approaches that provide the best results.</p>\n<h2>Four Approaches to Measuring Social Media Marketing</h2>\n<p>Tracking conversations about your brand is the core activity of most marketers and is probably the most common measurement activity that social teams engage in. The trick here is isolating the conversations that matter most to your brand, and that&#8217;s the rub. Most of the relevant conversations in social media will happen in unstructured, informal language in engagement platforms (like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Renren) that ar outside of your control. This means your measurement approach must be able to achieve the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Have a fast link to social networks.</strong> Measurement must be timely and that means accessing global social media in near real-time.</li>\n<li><strong>Be able to parse natural language.</strong> Listening to and measuring your brand&#8217;s KPIs in social media means understanding the idioms, syntax, slang, and regional languages.</li>\n<li><strong>Score relevancy of conversations.</strong> Every day, thousands &#8212; if not hundreds of thousands &#8212; of conversations about your products and services will occur in social media. Most are not critical to your business. But some absolutely are and can&#8217;t be ignored. Effective measurement methodologies can score/rank conversations and quantify them as needed to drive tactical and strategic goals.</li>\n<li><strong>Maintain accurate key measures of insight.</strong> At Dachis Group, we&#8217;ve boiled these down to four buckets: <em>Brand Awareness</em>, <em>Brand Love</em>, <em>Brand Mindshare</em>, and <em>Brand Advocacy</em>, but your mileage may vary. Whatever measurement system you design must be able to accurately track the key measures for your brand and keep them updated regularly.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As the industry has learned the hard way, the core lesson of social media is that your community of customers and business partners far outnumbers you. You simply shouldn&#8217;t (and can&#8217;t) do all the work <a href=\"http://www.informationweek.com/thebrainyard/commentary/strategy/240007492/how-to-scale-social-business-for-the-real-world\">to make social media work in scale</a>. Instead, you must encourage, enlist, and empower your advocates to partner in the effort. To do this, however, you need to know who your advocates are, and so this forms the next major measurement approach, which should focus on the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Identifying advocates and tracking them.</strong> Correlating across multiple social media accounts is key here as is understanding their level of influence.</li>\n<li><strong>Categorizing and segmenting advocates.</strong> The measurement system must understand if they are co-creators, mavens, amplifiers, helpers, sales prospects, and other business relevant roles (of which they will usually have multiple types.)</li>\n<li><strong>Making the measures actionable.</strong> Expertise location, amplification estimating tools, and other useful types of helper services that build on the data will make your investment in advocacy measures pay off.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Social media marketing rarely happens in a vacuum. It&#8217;s usually associated with other cross-channel marketing efforts as well as external events that are highly impactful or relevant to your brand, whether that is in the digital or real world, or both. Often, important events will transpire and be reflected in scale across your social channels. Brands must be able to track and influence these sometimes seismic events when they happen to tap into their power as well as head of any potential crises that can emerge from lack of awareness of or presence in these conversations. An effective measurement approach that will optimize the impact for marketing in these situations consists of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>An event detector.</strong> A measurement system should be able to identify significant events as they occur.</li>\n<li><strong>An event discriminator.</strong> This consists of scoring events such as their brand impact is understood to be major or minor.</li>\n<li><strong>An event correlator.</strong> Correlating significant events to conversations across social channels is required to understand their impact, what advocates are effected or can be enlisted in scale, and planning the brand&#8217;s engagement in response to the event.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Put simply, companies will manage to what they can measure. Connecting the activity of your social business efforts with business outcomes in an objective and consistent way will allow you accomplish many vital goals to sustain your social media marketing initiatives. This includes establishing and tracking ROI, understanding what parts of the business are benefiting most or need more attention, what&#8217;s working inside your funnel and what&#8217;s not, as well as if your efforts scale properly and result in concrete sales that can actually be tied directly to your engagement in social media. To do this, you&#8217;ll need to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Convert your raw measures into business intelligence.</strong> Have a way of turning all the qualitative and quantitative measures into artifacts that managers across your organization can use to understand and align their operations. Example: Do your measures show you that inbound social media sales inquiries being ignored? Then get that data into the right hands to do something about it.</li>\n<li><strong>Establish baselines that are compared frequently.</strong> Build a picture of your competencies and weaknesses, then get this data into a place where performance improvements will be sought. Rescore and baseline often, with the interval determining how fast you improve.</li>\n<li><strong>Build an integrated picture across your entire customer journey.</strong> As I <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/markfidelman/2012/11/26/rethinking-the-customer-journey-in-a-social-world/\">explored in Forbes earlier this week</a>, the customer journey is now continuous yet blurrier and less directed than ever before. Customers don&#8217;t discriminate channels or activities when it comes to consuming marketing, engaging in sales, seeking support, or trying to get you to change or improve your products. It&#8217;s all marketing now. Tie your benchmarks into a complete customer experience.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While there are certainly other approaches and measures that companies can focus on, we find that to be among the most effective and usable ones.

            },
            "content": {
              "rendered": "<p>On October 14, 2012 we witnessed a research mission to the edge of space that was breathtaking for its scope and shocking for the fact that it was orchestrated by a private corporation. The <a href=\"http://www.redbullstratos.com\">Red Bull Stratos</a> experiment broke scientific barriers, rekindled an era in human history when daredevils ruled the earth, and was inescapably cool. But there is another story here beyond the record books and beautiful aerial photography.</p>\n<p>To understand Red Bull Stratos we must acknowledge that at its core this whole experiment was a commercial endeavor. The real objective was to make every person in the world love Red Bull. Only time will tell if Red Bull sales increase commensurate to the Red Bull Stratos spectacle, but we can already see the brand impact of this campaign using the big data processing power of our Social Performance and Campaign Performance Monitor tools.</p>\n<p>The answer is that this campaign was not only unprecedented scientifically, it was also unprecedented from a brand marketing perspective. Red Bull Stratos is the clearest example we&#8217;ve ever seen of the new wave of advocacy driven brand marketing that we call Engagement@Scale. Here is what we learned:</p>\n<h2>There has never been a social campaign like Stratos</h2>\n<p>Our Social Performance and Campaign  Monitor tools are built upon the most cutting edge big data technology in the world. They simultaneously track the activity of 30,000 brands and 100,000,000 social accounts across every major social platform every 15 minutes every day, but the level of activity associated with this campaign exceeded anything we&#8217;ve ever seen. From a vanity metric perspective alone, the campaign was astounding:</p>\n<p><!--more (read me...)--><br />\n<a href=\"/?page_id=1752\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-105443\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/CTA-graphic-opt2.jpg\" alt=\"CTA-graphic-opt2\" width=\"735\" height=\"85\" /></a></p>\n<h3>Fact 1:  2,000,000 unique consumer actions</h3>\n<p>There were more than 2,000,000 specifically identifiable consumer actions associated with Stratos. Half of those actions (1,000,000 unique consumer actions!) occurred on the day of the jump.</p>\n<h3>Fact 2: 1,000,000 distinct Stratos participants</h3>\n<p>1,000,000 distinct user accounts contributed to the social conversation surrounding Red Bull Stratos. If you subscribe to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture)\" rel=\"nofollow\">traditional model</a> that for every 1 person creating content, there are 90 more lurking around and reading it, that suggests an audience of at least 90,000,000 following the campaign.</p>\n<h3>Fact 3: 2,000,000 new subscribers acquired</h3>\n<p>2,000,000 new accounts subscribed for Red Bull updates across all brand presences in the space of 15 days. These are engaged and interested subscribers, not ones acquired through display advertising or by gating a piece of content, and are a high quality audience that Red Bull can now directly interact with for months and years to come.</p>\n<h2>Stratos campaign engagement transcends &#8216;plus 1&#8217; or &#8216;like&#8217;</h2>\n<p>There were huge amounts of activity associated with Red Bull Stratos, but more importantly that activity indicated a high level of quality engagement that is quite unusual. Frequently, campaigns are dominated by simple &#8216;likes&#8217; or neutral commentary from the masses, but Red Bull Stratos was unequivocally positive and elicited meaningful interaction from people around the world.</p>\n<h3>Fact 4: 820,000 pieces of extremely positive content created</h3>\n<p>82% of the peak consumer activity associated with Red Bull was unequivocally positive (what we call &#8216;very positive signal&#8217;). On a base of 1,000,000 consumer actions that means there were approximately 820,000 pieces of Red Bull related consumer media that were unequivocally positive. To provide some context on this number in the exact same time period the next best performer was Starbucks with approximately 25% very positive signal.</p>\n<h3>Fact 5: 400% increase over average length of consumer engagement</h3>\n<p>Consumer posts and updates created throughout Stratos were not only positive, but they increased in length by more than 400% from standard engagement and only got longer over time. Length of a consumer generated post is a proxy for time and interest in a topic, so this kind of increase is a huge indicator for the depth of engagement within the Stratos audience.  People were not just hitting the retweet or like button on status updates. They were actively participating in the world&#8217;s largest watercooler conversation.</p>\n<h3>Fact 6: 50,000 distinct links shared</h3>\n<p>Red Bull remained at the heart of the discussion from start to finish. Dachis Group tracked more than 50,000 distinct links shared in the context of the Stratos campaign. But every one of the top 10 pointed to a Red Bull or Red Bull Stratos digital channel. This is a marketers dream. Stratos didn&#8217;t just feature Felix Baumgartner and a fall through the sky, it featured Red Bull branding in the context of nearly every comment or interaction at a massive scale.</p>\n<h2>Red Bull Stratos&#8217; brand impact was priceless</h2>\n<p>The most powerful form of brand marketing is trusted consumer generated messaging. By this measure, Red Bull Stratos established new highs for brand marketing in every way.</p>\n<h3>Fact 7: 61,634,000 trusted impressions generated</h3>\n<p>Stratos conversation generated more than 61,634,000 likely impressions across social channels. That means Red Bull garnered more than 60 million instances of peer-validated earned media through social as a result of Stratos.</p>\n<h2>Social Campaign Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Marketing has transitioned from a world of broadcast marketing to a world of peer to peer interaction. The future of brand marketing in digital and mobile channels is driven by trusted brand-related engagement  (advocacy). Advocacy is now the best way to create purchase intent for brand marketers. The challenge has been to generate advocacy in a scalable way since you can&#8217;t just throw money at the problem like you can with broadcast advertising.</p>\n<p>Through this lens Red Bull has done something remarkable with Stratos. They&#8217;ve created a mass advocacy campaign built on top of more than 60 million trusted consumer impressions &#8211; 82% of which were unequivocally positive. <em>It is impossible</em> to achieve this goal with a television advertisement or any other broadcast medium. You can buy impressions, but you can&#8217;t buy trust. No company has ever triggered brand advocacy at this scale and short of a similar flawlessly executed spectacle on this scale, it&#8217;s unclear that it will ever happen again. In that sense, Red Bull Stratos was a priceless brand experience that will almost certainly impact Red Bull&#8217;s business performance in a significant way.</p>\n<p><strong>Disclosure:</strong> Dachis Group and its subsidiary Archrival have conducted work for Red Bull.</p>\n<h3>Campaign and Case Study Methodology:</h3>\n<p>At Dachis Group, we focus on brand outcomes because we know that earned media generated online has a real impact on purchase intent and purchase incidence.
